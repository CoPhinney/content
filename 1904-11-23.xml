                <head>THE PASSAGE OF THE FLEET.</head>
                <p>We offer our sincere congratulations to the Government on the complete success of
                    the measures which it adopted during the recent passage of the 2nd division of
                    the Baltic Fleet through the Suez Canal. The stories spread by sensation-mongers
                    and bruited abroad by members of the Russian secret service, who presumably
                    wanted to show something for the pay squandered on them, had undoubtedly
                    obtained general credence in Russian naval and political circles. The squadron
                    was manned by crews most of whom knew as little of nautical life as Mr. W. 8.
                    Gilbert's sea-lord, its officers, if of some professional standing, had
                    expressed at Tangiers and elsewhere the most lively, and as the event proved,
                    the most needless apprehension of a Japanese attack. All the materials were at
                    hånd for a repetition of the Dogger incident which might have been fraught with
                    the most calamitous consequences to the whole world. The effective patrolling of
                    the banks and waters of the canal; the promptness with which our somewhat
                    embarrassing guests have been escorted through the ditch' without accident or
                    incident, and the entire absence of any hitch in the dispositions made by the
                    Government, deserve unstinted praise. That there was &amp; certain element of
                    comedy in proceedings which recalled the spectacle of an agitated family being
                    escorted over the safest of crossings, is obvious enough, but comedy might have
                    been followed by the most appalling tragedy in the narrow waters of the canal
                    but for the precautions of which we applaud the successful issue.</p>
                <p>There can only be one opinion amongst those who were officially connected with
                    the precautionary and other arrangements connected with the fleet's
                    visit—thankfulness that no untoward incident took place. It was out of the
                    question to suppose that the Japanese, who have behaved throughout the war with
                    an exemplary correctness never excelled by any other nation, would be parties to
                    any dastardly outrage in neutral waters. Trouble was only looked for from the
                    Russian fleet itself. Every credit is due to the Canal Company's staff, the
                    Coast Guards, and police officials, for the excellent manner in which the
                    arrangements were made and carried out ; but whether they were made for the
                    purpose of protecting the fleet from a possible treacherous Japanese attack, or
                    for the purpose of comforting the excited minds of the officers of the fleet,
                    and 80 saving them from once more making themselves notorious, it would perhaps
                    not be well to ask.</p>
                <p>The satirical article reprinted from the Pall Mall Gazette in our issue of 24th
                    inst. was not altogether uncalled for. It is a fact that the authorities
                    actually stopped the firing of the morning and evening Ramadan guns, lest the
                    distant report should throw the fleet into another wild panic. Many of the other
                    precautions taken were equally ludicrous, but they cannot be said to have been
                    uncalled for. The wonder is that any admiral would allow his fleet to be nursed
                    and tended in a way calculated to excite the contempt and ridicule of all
                    nations.</p>

                    found in the men's effects. The sailors wrecked their own quarters, and also
                    those of the officers belonging to other naval divisions, who refused to join
                    them. The pickets fired upon the rioters, wounding many and evet: tually

                    heading "Ellerman Lines, Ltd.," (City and City and Hall Lines), which is
                    entirely incorrect and misleading, the steamers named therein being the Ellerman
                    liners between London and Liverpool and Alexandria, for which I am agent. I
                    shall be obliged by your calling attention to this in your next issue, as the
                    only paper I advertise in at present is the Egyptian Gazette.</p>

                <p>THE BUDGET FOR 1905.</p>
                <p>THE ESTIMATES</p>
                <p>The following are the budgetary estimates for 1905 :Revenne...</p>

                <p>Surplus ... ... ... L.E. 500,000 The estimates of revenue do not include the LE.
                    216,000 taken from the General Reserve Fund for the relief of taxation.</p>
                <p>The land transfer dues have been reduced to 2%, which has brought about a
                    decrease in revenue of L.E.250,000. A diminution in receipts of L.E.16,000 is
                    also provided for owing to the suppression of the boat dues. On the other hand,
                    there figures in the Estimates a sum of L.E.135,000, being the product of the
                    sales of Free State property.</p>
                <p>The estimates of expenditure do not include the sum of L.E.265,000, representing
                    the economies resulting from the conversion of the Privileged Debt, which have
                    hitherto been paid into the Fonds des Economies de la Conversion.</p>
                <p>The actual increase in the expenditure amounts to L.E. 604,000, the greater
                    portion of which figures in the Budget of Public Works, Railways, and Public
                    Instruction.</p>
                <p>A sum of L.E. 447,000 has been set aside for the special expenditure of the year,
                    which up to now had been taken from the Reserve Fund.</p>
                <p>RAILWAY COMMISSION. We hear on good authority that the construction of the line
                    from Salhieh to Kantara has been approved in principle, though work is not
                    likely to be begun there till the Railway Commission has presented its
                    report.</p>
                <p>The members of the Commission left for Upper Egypt on Saturday. They inspected
                    the Payoum line and stations and spent the night at Seilah station. Yesterday
                    they inspected the line and stations between Wasta and Melawi.</p>
                <p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. The Council of Ministers, which was held at Abdeen Palace
                    on Saturday, gave its approval to the budgetary estimates for the coming year
                    and to the Note of the Financial Adviser thereon. The fusion of the Helouan and
                    Delta railways, the creation of a Sudan Irrigation Service, and the nomination
                    of Messrs. Mitchell Innes and Rooca Serra to the Committee of Egyptian
                    Antiquities also received the approbation of the Council.</p>
                <p>IRRIGATION WORKS. By Khedivial decree the Moudirs of Gharbieh, Galioubieh,
                    Dakahlieh, Keneh, and Assouan are commanded to convoke the provincial councils
                    of their respective Moudiriehs to examine the local irrigation works proposed
                    for 1905. In place of the chief engineers of the Moudiriehs the Inspectors of
                    Irrigation may be present, with &amp; voice in the deliberations of the
                    councils.</p>
                <p>The dates of these meetings are as follows: Galioubieb, Deo. 3; Gbarbieh, Deo.4,
                    Dakahlieh, Dec. 5; Keneh, Dec. 24 ; Assouan, Dec. 27.</p>
                <p>BRASSERIES DES PYRAMIDES. No less than 49,000 shares were applied for, but as the
                    new issue only consisted of 5,000 shares, the share-holders of the company, who
                    had the right of preference, were allotted 4,550 shares, while the outside
                    public received one per cent.</p>
                <p>THE HOUSING SCHEME. Mr. Geo. B. Alderson writes : - My scheme is not based on any
                    plea of poverty nor want of work for artisans. The foundation of the whole idea
                    is due to the utter want of accommodation Jin Alexandria for artisans. In
                    consequence of this dearth of suitable houses, good, honest and industrious
                    workmen have to live in "Tat holes." without water laid on, because the
                    landlords fear that their houses would collapse if the water pipes leaked. The
                    "rat holes" are never repaired because the landlords assert that they are not
                    worth repairing. In many cases even these dwellings have only holes in the top
                    of the walls for light. Their sanitary condition is deplorable. My demand for
                    gas is confined to the corridors alone. The project of remitting the 2 % tenants
                    tax on these sınall tenements, averaging £1 per month rent, is based on the
                    enormous expense of collecting these taxes in such cases. The scheme is worked
                    out on a commercial basis and would provide a sure and profitable savings bank
                    for the artisan, I ask for land sufficient to build seven such blocks, which
                    would accommodate, roughly, say 1,000 families, possibly more, as many would be
                    subdivided. If it is too much to ask for the grant of the land, then I would ask
                    for &amp; perpetual lease at a peppercorn rent. If they ask us to purchase, then
                    to raise the capital becomes a speculation, and I fear in the end we should be
                    in the same plight again as we are now. If the above scheme is not feasible, how
                    is this urgent want to be provided for</p>

                <p>"OFFICERS ALL DRUNK.”</p>
                <p>CORRESPONDENTS EXPERIENCES.</p>
                <p>Mr. Reginald Wyon, the Correspondent of the Daily Mail at Vienna, arrived at
                    Alexandrie on Saturday evening by the Russian steamer Emperor Nicholas II., from
                    Crete, and is staying at the Khedivial Hotel. He was at Canea during the time
                    the Russian Fleet was there and gives a terrible account of the outrages
                    committed by the officers and men.</p>
                <p>During the thirteen days he stayed at Canea the streets were quite unsafe. Any
                    woman found in the streets was pursued and treated with great rudeness, if the
                    miscreants happened to catch her. The bars were looted</p>
                <p>and the restaurants were wrecked. Officers and men I were often "roaring" drunk
                    at 9 a.m., and many</p>
                <p>of them lay in a helpless state of intoxication all about the quay and streets.
                    The Cretans</p>
                <p>characterized them as absolute barbarians. | Both officers and men spent any
                    amount of money at Canea and at night the scenes baffled description. All the
                    sailors used to come ashore, while many lived on shore and overstayed their
                    leave with impunity. When evening came on bands of them used to raid the streets
                    and the fighting amongst themselves was of a ferocious description. In one night
                    alone three Russians were killed by their fellows in a most brutal manner, for
                    they were jumped upon as they lay prostrate until their skulls were completely
                    smashed in!</p>
                <p>A significant confession, Mr. Wyon informed | us, was made by many of the
                    officers and men I while at Canea. They declared that they were all drink on the
                    night of the incident on the</p>
                <p>Dogger Bank. They all expressed a bitter hate | of England. Mr. Wyon was himself
                    attacked | by drunken sailors while riding in the country in the presence of
                    some officers, who did not take the slightest notice. His immunity from serious
                    maltreatment during his stay at Canea was due to the fact that he pretended to
                    be a | German, as no Englishman's life would have been secure at the hands of
                    these ruffians. All the sailors expressed open contempt of the capacity of their
                    officers.</p>
                <p>The following incident is sufficient to show I the discipline prevailing. Two
                    officers of I different ranks had a dispute on board a destroyer. They quarreled
                    in front of the crew and the inferior officer drew a revolver on his superior.
                    The latter jumped into the sea to save his life, but as he could not swim he was
                    nearly drowned. He was picked up and got ashore, where he stayed for three days,
                    during which time he was always drunk. On the fourth day he came aboard and made
                    it up with the other officers. This destroyer is now lat Piraeus. She ran down
                    &amp; Greek vessel after leaving Crete, and damaged herself so considerably that
                    she had to go into dock at Piraeus.</p>

                <p>CONDITION OF HELOUAN.</p>
                <p>PETITION OF INHABITANTS.</p>
                <p>The following is the text of a petition submitted by the inhabitants of Helouan
                    Town to the Earl of Cromer, the Minister of Public Works, the Minister of
                    Finance, and the Minister of the Interior:</p>
                <p>"The undersigned, owners of property in, and residents of Helouan, beg to submit
                    on behalf of themselves, other inhabitants and visitors to the town of Helouan
                    the following:-!</p>
                <p>1. They invite the attention of the Govern- ! ment to the many previous
                    complaints they have made with regard to the unsatisfactory working of the
                    Cairo-Helouan Railway Co., and they request the authorities to take the oppor.
                    tunity of the transfer of the concession of the Helouan Railway Co. to the Delta
                    Light Railway Company to safeguard the interests of Helouan and its inhabitants
                    in promoting a thoroughly efficient service.</p>
                <p>2. They draw the attention of the authorities to the present condition of the
                    streets and roads both as regards cleanliness, lighting and repair, to the
                    unfiltered and therefore dirty condition of the water supplied to the houses for
                    drinking and other purposes, and they also feel very considerably the absence of
                    any road for vehicular traffic between Cairo and Helouan. There are also several
                    matters of less importance, such as the embellishment of the town, the providing
                    of public attractions, and the planting of trees along the streets, which they
                    think should be taken in hand.</p>
                <p>3. Since the crying needs of the town are so great they think it a great hardship
                    that money derived from the local taxation should be allocated to objects in
                    which they have no concern-for instance, the amount paid by the town of Helouan
                    last year in house-tax, water and other rates amounted to about £6,000, of which
                    sum only about £1,750 was allotted to the town of Helouan.</p>
                <p>4. They also object to the constitution of the present Local Commission :</p>
                <p>Firstly, inasmuch as its members have no real power in promoting the interests of
                    the town.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the unworkable character of the Commission, the official members not
                    being responsible to the Commission as a body but to the heads of the
                    departments of which they happen to be the nominees. They therefore humbly
                    request the conversion of the Local Commission into a genuine responsible
                    "Municipality," or that the administration of the town be placed in charge of a
                    Government Department, as it was before the creation of the Local
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>5. Owing to the urgency of these grievances your petitioners beg and pray that
                    there petition be considered at an early date so that it | possibly the
                    financial part may be rectified in this year's coming Budget.</p>
                <p>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY. The next meeting of the Municipal Commission will take
                    place on Wednesday, the 30th inst. at 9 p.m. The following is the official
                    programme of the proceedings -</p>
                <p>1. Communications diverses (lettre ministé. rielle relative au nouveau réglement

                <p>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE. The final performance of the Italian opera company which has
                    been performing at this theater for the past month was given last night, Il
                    Trovatore being staged, while Mignon was given in the afternoon, before a large
                    and delighted audience. It goes without saying that with such artists as Signa.
                    Monti-Baldini and Sig. Tomasini, the representation of the opera was excellent.
                    | Carmen was given on the previous evening, | when Signa. Monti-Baldini gave of
                    her best. JA better Carmen than that presented by this</p>
                <p>charming artiste it would be impossible to find. Signa Monti-Baldini throws her
                    whole soul into the character and invests it with a degree of interest which we
                    have found lacking in most other exponents.</p>
                <p>The company leaves for Cairo to-day and will open at the Verdi Theatre, probably
                    on Wednesday, with Aida.</p>
                <p>ZIZINIA THEATRE. M. de Tisci Rubini, the celebrated bass, will take the role of
                    King Mark in Tristan et Iseult at the Zizinis Theater this evening, on the
                    occasion of the opening performance of the Italian opera company,<note

                <p> NOTES FROM SUAKIN.</p>
                <p> SINKING OF BRITISH PINNACE.</p>
                <p> (FROM OUR OW2 CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                <p> Suakin, November 19. H. M. S. Sealark left here on the 7th inat. for</p>
                <p> survey work and returned yesterday. Dur. ng surveying operations the</p>
                <p> vessel encountered heavy weather, which caused the loss of her steam</p>
                <p> pinnace. The latter was being loved by the Sealark while they were</p>
                <p> making for some landmarks. A heavy ses swept over the pinnace and caused</p>
                <p> it to sink. She then burned over and in doing so the tow ropes broke.</p>
                <p> She sank in about 40 fathoms of water. No explosion of the boiler</p>
                <p> occurred and ill hands were saved.</p>
                <p> A football match takes place this afternoon between H.M.8. Sealark and</p>
                <p> “Suakin." The local team stands a good chance of winning as they have</p>
                <p> had a good deal of practice lately and have some excellent players,</p>
                <p> including Kaimakam Drury Bey.</p>
                <p> The Khedivial mail steamer arrived here from Suez on the 17th and brought</p>
                <p> about 74 passengers for Suakin. Amongst them were Mr. and Mrs. Gaiger,</p>
                <p> the former English secretary to the Director, Sudan Railways, Suakin,</p>
                <p> and Mr. Maylor, the engineer sent out to erect the condensers for the</p>
                <p> Suakin Railway. Mr. Bailey, head foreman of works, Suakin, had charge of</p>
                <p> the temporary erection of the two condenser boilers, and Mr. Maylor will</p>
                <p> erect the remainder.</p>
                <p> Bimbashi P. C. Lord, R.E., Acting Chief Engineer, Buskin Railway, has</p>
                <p> been confined to his house for the last fortnight through illness, but</p>
                <p> is now feeling better, and it is hoped that in a few days he will be</p>
                <p> able to resume his duties.</p>
                <p> The telephone exchange is now complete between Suakin and Graham's Point,</p>
                <p> and all the offices at both ends can now communicate with each other.</p>
                <p> Telephone communication is also being pushed forward on the railway</p>
                <p> line, under the supervision of Corporal George, R.E. They have reached</p>
                <p> Handoub already and in a day or two will be at Railhead, so that Suakin,</p>
                <p> Graham's Point, and Railhead will be in communication.</p>
                <p> Colonel Macauley Bey, Director, Sudan Rail. ways, is expected here by the</p>
                <p> next steamer from Suez.</p>
                <p> It is rumored that H.E. Sirdar is likely to pay a visit here in</p>
                <p> March.</p>
                <p> The 8.8. Mahallah, which arrived here on the 17th inst., brought an</p>
                <p> engineer and several workmen with implements and tools for the digging</p>
                <p> of wells at Sheikh Barghout, which of course is to be the new Sudan</p>
                <p> port.</p>
                <p> Mr. Achille-Kredi, the sub-contractor of the new Alexandria quays,</p>
                <p> arrived by the same steamer in order to study the place. He will</p>
                <p> probably obtain contracts for dredging the barbour, constructing quays,</p>
                <p> eto. He returned to Suez to-day by the S.S. Rahmanieh.</p>
                <p> The 8.8. Calioubieh arrived here from Suez yesterday with stores for the</p>
