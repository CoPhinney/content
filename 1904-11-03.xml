                                <p>Coquelin Ainé makes his debut at the Zizinia Theatre tomorrow
                                    evening in Molière's comedy Tartufe, in which he will play the
                                    title role. It will be interesting if we give a few particulars
                                    of the great French actor's life. Coquelin Ainé is the son of a
                                    baker, and was destined originally to follow that trade. but
                                    evincing a great aptitude for the stage, he went to Paris and
                                    was admitted to the Conservatoire on December 29, 1859, joining
                                    M. Regnier's class, of which he became the most brilliant pupil.
                                    He obtained the second prize for comedy, and made his debut at
                                    the Théâtre Français on December 7, 1860, in the character of
                                    Gros-René in the "Dépit Amoureux." He afterwards played with
                                    success in the "Fourberies de Scapin," "Mariage de Figaro," "Don
                                    Juan," and other classical pieces; Lupin in "La Mère Confidente;

                                    Mycille," M. Coquelin has obtained great success in society by
                                    reciting in private and at public meetings, and has thus added
                                    to the reputation of new poets, particularly of Eugène Manuel
                                    and François Coppée. In 1886 he was put on the list of
                                    "societaires pensionnaires" of the Theatre Français, and this
                                    prevented him from appearing as an actor in any French theatre.
                                    But, after travelling abroad in America and Alsace at the head
                                    of a dramatic company of his own formation, he re-entered the
                                    Comedie Française in December, 1889, and played Mascarille,
                                    Diafoirus, and Argente, and other parts, in order to support his
                                    son Jean, at that time making his first appearances as an actor.
                                    He created the part of Labussière in M. Sardou's "Thermidor,"
                                    which after three representations was interdicted by the French
                                    Government His next creation was (January 25, 1891). Petruccio
                                    in a modified version of the "Taming of the Shrew" (Nov. 1892).
                                    As his engagement at the Theatre Français lasts only six months
                                    each year, he has recently taken to touring abroad with a
                                    company of his own selection, and in the summer of 1892 he
                                    brought "Thermi- dor" and "La Megère Apprivoisée" to London. He
                                    is the author of several works on the comedian's art. </p>

                            <p>We have been favoured with some interest- ing details regarding the
                                progress being made by the Kom Ombo Company, which is engaged in
                                undertaking the development of the great plain extending from the
                                Nile to Giebel Silsileh. The undertaking is financed by Sir Ernest.
                                Cassel and Messrs. Suares and Cattaui. The concession extends to
                                120,000 feddans, with the option of taking up another 40,000 feddans
                                at a slightly higher level, which is now about to be surveyed. </p>
                            <p>A correspondent, writing on the subject, says:</p>
                            <p>The work which is now being done at Kom Ombo is one of the most
                                important under- takings which has ever been attempted in this
                                country. The Suez Canal and the Assouan Dam may take precedence of
                                it, but, for my part, I have no objection to stating that the work
                                now being taken in hand at Kom Ombo is fully entitled to take the
                                third place. Nobody, who has not visited and personally inspected
                                the works, can have the slightest conception of their magnitude and
                                of the enormous task, which has been undertaken in order to make
                                this huge desert plain a smiling area of cultivated land. It is a
                                great pity that the disaster of last year, when the pumping building
                                tumbled down, should have greatly impeded the work. At present the
                                pamping installation is being rapidly developed. The levelling of
                                the land, the making of canals, the laying of the piping, and the
                                many other odd jobs, necessitated by such a gigantic undertaking,
                                are being rapidly brought to completion to enable crops to be grown
                                at an early date. No less than four thousand men are now engaged on
                                the work. One of the most remarkable portions of the work is the
                                pumping installation. Vast shops have been erected for the pumps and
                                all the other kinds of mechanical works. Birch Bey is the great
                                organiser and manager of this property. From the conversation which
                                I had with him, he appeared to be quite satisfied with the progress
                                that is being made and he stated that he had no doubt but that Sir
                                Ernest Cassel would be equally satisfied. </p>

                                has been placed in the hands of the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and
                                Hotel Company, who are charged with the whole of the order. The
                                fleet will consist of six barges, two passenger steamers, and two
                                tugs, and all these vessels will be built in England. They will be
                                delivered by June 1, 1905. By that date it is hoped to open a
                                portion of the canal (30 kilomètres) between Matarieh and Port Said.
                                This will be a great advantage for pas- sengers. The Belgian company
                                which has a light railway in this part of the Delta will run a

                            <p>NEW HARBOUR WORKS.</p>
                            <p> At the end of last year the Suez Canal Company invited tenders for
                                making two new basins on the Asiatic side of Port Said harbour, one
                                of which was to accommodate the colliers that discharge there and,
                                the other the petro- leum tank steamers. </p>
                            <p>Among the numerous tenders received from all parts of Europe, that
                                sent in by the Société de Grands Travaux de Marseille was accepted.
                                Including the additional or supplementary works that the Canal
                                Company will carry out itself, the total cost of constructing these
                                two new basins will amount to about three million franes, or
                                £120,000. Once these basins are completed, that now known as the
                                "Bassin Abbas," near the waterworks, on the African side, will be
                                utilized for steamers generally, other than the colliers which at
                                present use it exclusively. </p>
                            <p>The Suez Canal Company intends likewise to considerably imprové the
                                two other basins, known by the names of the Bassin de l'Arsenal and
                                the Bassin Chérif, on the same side of the shore, by enlarging and
                                deepening them and adapting or making them available also for cargo
                                steamers of the largest tonnage and draught. As a result of these
                                improvements and changes the general workshops will have to be
                                removed elsewhere. They will, at the same time, be much enlarged,
                                remodelled, and improved. After a long study of this question the
                                chief engineer of the company, now in Paris, recommended that the
                                new buildings should be erected on the Asiatic side of the harbour,
                                opposite the town, where sufficient space is available, and at this
                                moment a definite project is before the directors for their
                                approval. </p>
                            <p>On the other hand, a short time back the Canal Company imported three
                                large porteurs, floating receivers or mud tanks, which are used, in
                                connection with the powerful marine dredgers in the port. To
                                increase the dredging operations necessary to keep the port at a
                                uniform and requisite depth, the company has ordered another steamer
                                dredger and mud tank combined, of the type known as the Puissante.

                            <head> MURDER IN A THEATRE.</head>
                            <p> A DASTARDLY OUTRAGE.</p>
                            <p> The Eden Music-hall at Alexandria, where the recent fire panic took
                                place, was the scene last night of a dastardly outrage. </p>
                            <p>About 10.30 p.m., whilst the performance was going on, the
                                ticket-collector was seen to t rush into the auditorium closely
                                pursued by the man in charge of the box-office, of Greek
                                nationality, who carried a dagger in his hand. The latter fell upon
                                his victim and inflicted a deep wound in the back, from which the
                                man fell in front of the stage. He attempted to rise and escape, but
                                was furiously attacked twice and fell dying at the side entrance of
                                the i theatre, leaving a trail of blood behind him. The audience,
                                panic-striken, rushed to the exits of the theatre, and it was left
                                to the fireman on duty to effect the capture of the murderer. The
                                latter seized his belt axe and felled the man to the ground near his
                                dying victim. The murderer, however, escaped the clutches of the
                                fireman and was finally arrested as he emerged into the open street
                                by the ghaffir on duty on a sign from the fireman, who blew his
                                whistle. </p>
                            <p>The man so brutally attacked, who is an Italian, was removed to the
                                Greek Hospital, but expired on the way. His assassin has been
                                incarcerated at Labbane caracol pending his trial. </p>
                            <p>The motive of the crime has not as yet transpired, but it evidently
                                arose from a violent quarrel which the two men had at the entrance
                                of the theatre. </p>
