                    <head>THE BALTIC FLEET.</head>
                    <p>According to a telegram from London to day, the negotiations between Great
                        Britain and Russia in regard to what has been de- scribed by Lord Rosebery
                        as the "unspeakable outrage" of the Russian Baltic Fleet, are pro- gressing.
                        The commission which is to study the matter will probably consist of an
                        admital and a legal adviser on both sides, together with naval officers
                        belonging to neutrals. Great Britain is in favour of Paris, and Russia of
                        The Hague, as the place for the meeting. Other essential points require the
                        most careful consi- deration. Meanwhile, we are told, the Russian fleet will
                        probably be thousands of miles away before the enquiry even begins. This
                        does not </p>

                    <p>sound satisfactory, but we have sufficient confidence in the Government to
                        believe that every guarantee has been received that the fleet will no longer
                        constitute a menace to our shipping. We are content to await the results of
                        the enquiry with calm and dignified patience. The attitude of England has,
                        indeed, throughout been characterised with admirable calmness. The outrage
                        touched us vitally. The offence was not only one against the lives of
                        English. men, it was an outrage committed on the high seas against the
                        nation which claims to rule the waves. Nothing could so stir the country as
                        an atrocity which touches a maritime people in so sensitive a spot, and
                        nothing could seem more dastardly to English ideas than a coward- ly attack,
                        whether deliberate or unpremeditated, upon unarmed and defenceless men. Had
                        the fishermen been French, or of any other nationality, our indignation
                        would scarcely have been less, though our personal honour would not have
                        been involved. The measure of our anger's depth, and the measure of our de-1
                        termination, may be taken by the calmness we continue to display. It is a
                        dangerous calm, symptomatic of feelings that are too deep and sacred for
                        words or demonstration. It is earnestly to be hoped that it is properly
                        understood abroad, and especially at St. Petersburg. For any misapprehension
                        which confuses patience with pusillanimity, or moderation with readiness to
                        allow this outrage to be passed over as other outrages, almost as
                        "unspeakable," have been, will as surely lead to disaster as that obstirate
                        defiance by Russia of which perturbing signals have not been lacking. There.
                        is no shred of division or irresolution in Great and Greater Britain. Never
                        before has the country been so absolutely one. If quarrel we must have we
                        have that quarrel just, and once in we will so bear ourselves that others
                        may beware of us. Our conscience acquits us of bellicose or Chauvinistic
                        impatience. We have borne ourselves like men in our treatment of an
                        unparalleled situation. We still earnestly hope that our moderation and
                        dignity will be rewarded as they deserve. But if it fall out otherwise, we
                        shall bear ourselves like men to the bitter end, strong in the justice of
                        our cause</p>

                    <head>THE WAR.</head>
                    <p>The only war news we have to-day is contained in a telegram from Tokio
                        reporting a tremendous bombardment of Port Arthur, the fall of which is said
                        to be near at hand. Meantime, all is quiet in Manchuria, though we may hear
                        at any time that the Japanese have resumed the offensive. The annals of
                        scientific warfare would be vainly searched for any tactical position re-
                        sembling that of the two vast armies now facing one another between
                        Liao-yang and Mukden. For fully two weeks, each of these immense forces has
                        virtually stood at bay, challenging the other to come on. Pretty equally
                        matched in numbers and pugnacity, they only wait for an order to rush at the
                        foe, and obedience will be rendered with all possible alacrity. But Marshal
                        Oyama and General Kuropatkin are concerned with matters of higher moment
                        from their respective standpoints. It was the Russian late effort to march
                        south, to relieve Port Arthur, which influenced the Japanese commander to
                        replace offensive strategy by defensive. Similarly, it was the Japanese
                        impetuous northerly advance that constrained Kuropatkin, after the failure
                        of his attempt to get south, to halt on the Sha-ho. In the one case, the
                        object is the capture of Port Arthur by starvation and storm combined before
                        relief arrives; in the other, the Russians feel them- selves bound to retain
                        possession of Mukden. at any cost. In effect, it is a game of patience, and
                        it only remains to be seen which side will be the first to give way to
                        irritation at the delay </p>

                                in Molière's comedy Tartufe, in which he will play the title role.
                                It will be interesting if we give a few particulars of the great
                                French actor's life. Coquelin Ainé is the son of a baker, and was
                                destined originally to follow that trade. but evincing a great
                                aptitude for the stage, he went to Paris and was admitted to the
                                Conservatoire on December 29, 1859, joining M. Regnier's class, of
                                which he became the most brilliant pupil. He obtained the second
                                prize for comedy, and made his debut at the Théâtre Français on
                                December 7, 1860, in the character of Gros-René in the "Dépit
                                Amoureux." He afterwards played with success in the "Fourberies de
                                Scapin," "Mariage de Figaro," "Don Juan," and other classical
                                pieces; Lupin in "La Mère Confidente; the Marquis in "Le Joueur;"
                                Annibal in "L'Aventurière," He created the role of Anatole in "Une
                                Loge d'Opera," John in "Trop Curieux," Gagneux in "Jean Baudry,"
                                Vincent in "L'Eillet Blanc," Aristide in "Le Lion Amoureux,"
                                Gringoire in the play of that name, Beaubourg in "Paul Forestier,"
                                Eucrate in "Le Coq de Mycille," M. Coquelin has obtained great
                                success in society by reciting in private and at public meetings,
                                and has thus added to the reputation of new poets, particularly of
                                Eugène Manuel and François Coppée. In 1886 he was put on the list of
                                "societaires pensionnaires" of the Theatre Français, and this
                                prevented him from appearing as an actor in any French theatre. But,
                                after travelling abroad in America and Alsace at the head of a
                                dramatic company of his own formation, he re-entered the Comedie
                                Française in December, 1889, and played Mascarille, Diafoirus, and
                                Argente, and other parts, in order to support his son Jean, at that
                                time making his first appearances as an actor. He created the part
                                of Labussière in M. Sardou's "Thermidor," which after three
                                representations was interdicted by the French Government His next
                                creation was (January 25, 1891). Petruccio in a modified version of
                                the "Taming of the Shrew" (Nov. 1892). As his engagement at the
                                Theatre Français lasts only six months each year, he has recently
                                taken to touring abroad with a company of his own selection, and in
                                the summer of 1892 he brought "Thermi- dor" and "La Megère
                                Apprivoisée" to London. He is the author of several works on the
                                comedian's art. </p>

                        <head> THE KOM OMBO CO.</head>
                        <p>A GREAT UNDERTAKING.</p>
                        <p>We have been favoured with some interest- ing details regarding the
                            progress being made by the Kom Ombo Company, which is engaged in
                            undertaking the development of the great plain extending from the Nile
                            to Giebel Silsileh. The undertaking is financed by Sir Ernest. Cassel
                            and Messrs. Suares and Cattaui. The concession extends to 120,000
                            feddans, with the option of taking up another 40,000 feddans at a
                            slightly higher level, which is now about to be surveyed. </p>
                        <p>A correspondent, writing on the subject, says:</p>
                        <p>The work which is now being done at Kom Ombo is one of the most important
                            under- takings which has ever been attempted in this country. The Suez
                            Canal and the Assouan Dam may take precedence of it, but, for my part, I
                            have no objection to stating that the work now being taken in hand at
                            Kom Ombo is fully entitled to take the third place. Nobody, who has not
                            visited and personally inspected the works, can have the slightest
                            conception of their magnitude and of the enormous task, which has been
                            undertaken in order to make this huge desert plain a smiling area of
                            cultivated land. It is a great pity that the disaster of last year, when
                            the pumping building tumbled down, should have greatly impeded the work.
                            At present the pamping installation is being rapidly developed. The
                            levelling of the land, the making of canals, the laying of the piping,
                            and the many other odd jobs, necessitated by such a gigantic
                            undertaking, are being rapidly brought to completion to enable crops to
                            be grown at an early date. No less than four thousand men are now
                            engaged on the work. One of the most remarkable portions of the work is
                            the pumping installation. Vast shops have been erected for the pumps and
                            all the other kinds of mechanical works. Birch Bey is the great
                            organiser and manager of this property. From the conversation which I
                            had with him, he appeared to be quite satisfied with the progress that
                            is being made and he stated that he had no doubt but that Sir Ernest
                            Cassel would be equally satisfied. </p>

                        <p>The powerful new dredger for the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company
                            has now been built, and it is expected that it will be at work in about
                            a week's time. The order for the fleet of this company has been placed
                            in the hands of the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company, who
                            are charged with the whole of the order. The fleet will consist of six
                            barges, two passenger steamers, and two tugs, and all these vessels will
                            be built in England. They will be delivered by June 1, 1905. By that
                            date it is hoped to open a portion of the canal (30 kilomètres) between
                            Matarieh and Port Said. This will be a great advantage for pas- sengers.
                            The Belgian company which has a light railway in this part of the Delta
                            will run a service of specially quick trains from Mansourah to Matarieh
                            in connection with the boats of the Menzaleh Company. The time occupied
                            on the journey from Matarieh to Port Said will thus be shortened to five
                            hours. </p>

                        <p>NEW HARBOUR WORKS.</p>
                        <p> At the end of last year the Suez Canal Company invited tenders for
                            making two new basins on the Asiatic side of Port Said harbour, one of
                            which was to accommodate the colliers that discharge there and, the
                            other the petro- leum tank steamers. </p>
                        <p>Among the numerous tenders received from all parts of Europe, that sent
                            in by the Société de Grands Travaux de Marseille was accepted. Including
                            the additional or supplementary works that the Canal Company will carry
                            out itself, the total cost of constructing these two new basins will
                            amount to about three million franes, or £120,000. Once these basins are
                            completed, that now known as the "Bassin Abbas," near the waterworks, on
                            the African side, will be utilized for steamers generally, other than
                            the colliers which at present use it exclusively. </p>
                        <p>The Suez Canal Company intends likewise to considerably imprové the two
                            other basins, known by the names of the Bassin de l'Arsenal and the
                            Bassin Chérif, on the same side of the shore, by enlarging and deepening
                            them and adapting or making them available also for cargo steamers of
                            the largest tonnage and draught. As a result of these improvements and
                            changes the general workshops will have to be removed elsewhere. They
                            will, at the same time, be much enlarged, remodelled, and improved.
                            After a long study of this question the chief engineer of the company,
                            now in Paris, recommended that the new buildings should be erected on
                            the Asiatic side of the harbour, opposite the town, where sufficient
                            space is available, and at this moment a definite project is before the
                            directors for their approval. </p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a short time back the Canal Company imported three
                            large porteurs, floating receivers or mud tanks, which are used, in
                            connection with the powerful marine dredgers in the port. To increase
                            the dredging operations necessary to keep the port at a uniform and
                            requisite depth, the company has ordered another steamer dredger and mud
                            tank combined, of the type known as the Puissante. Of the new floating
                            dock recently arrived at Port Said from England we have already given

                        <p> A DASTARDLY OUTRAGE.</p>
                        <p> The Eden Music-hall at Alexandria, where the recent fire panic took
                            place, was the scene last night of a dastardly outrage. </p>
                        <p>About 10.30 p.m., whilst the performance was going on, the
                            ticket-collector was seen to t rush into the auditorium closely pursued
                            by the man in charge of the box-office, of Greek nationality, who
                            carried a dagger in his hand. The latter fell upon his victim and
                            inflicted a deep wound in the back, from which the man fell in front of
                            the stage. He attempted to rise and escape, but was furiously attacked
                            twice and fell dying at the side entrance of the i theatre, leaving a
                            trail of blood behind him. The audience, panic-striken, rushed to the
                            exits of the theatre, and it was left to the fireman on duty to effect
                            the capture of the murderer. The latter seized his belt axe and felled
                            the man to the ground near his dying victim. The murderer, however,
                            escaped the clutches of the fireman and was finally arrested as he
                            emerged into the open street by the ghaffir on duty on a sign from the
                            fireman, who blew his whistle. </p>
                        <p>The man so brutally attacked, who is an Italian, was removed to the Greek
                            Hospital, but expired on the way. His assassin has been incarcerated at
                            Labbane caracol pending his trial. </p>
                        <p>The motive of the crime has not as yet transpired, but it evidently arose
                            from a violent quarrel which the two men had at the entrance of the

                        <head>DEATH OF ARABIC SCHOLAR.</head>
                        <p> The Morning Post of last Friday says We regret to announce that
                            Professor H.. Anthony Salmoné, Professor of Arabie at King's College,
                            London, died at his residence, 47, Powis-square, from apoplexy. Of
                            Cretan parentage, he was born in Beyrout in 1860 and educated in the
                            university of that city. Soon after coming to this country he was
                            appointed professor of Arabic at University College, Lon- don, and in
                            1890 he received the appointment of professor at King's College. In the
                            same year he published an important Arabic-English and English-Arabic
                            Lexicon in two volumes and received a gratifying acknowledgment of his
                            work from the Sultan, who sent him the Order of the Medji-lich of the
                            Third Class in re- cognition of the services he had rendered to Oriental
                            literature. For many years Professor Salmoné, by his addresses and
                            writings, laboured to draw attention to the necessity of encouraging
                            Oriental studies in Great Britain, and he contributed miscellaneous
                            articles to the reviews and newspapers, including the Morning Post. He
                            published in 1896 a book on "The Fall and Resurrection of Turkey," and
                            devised and edited "The Imperial Souvenir," an in- teresting work which
                            was dedicated by special permission to Queen Victoria. It gives a
                            metrical translation of the third verse of the National Anthem in fifty
                            languages spoken in the British Empire. </p>

                        <head>THE CAIRO ROADS.</head>
                        <p>Since the 3rd October traffic has been stopped on that portion of the
                            Attaba el- Khadra leading from the entrance to the Mohamed Aly-street to
                            the beginning of the Mousky. The shopkeepers have suffered very greatly
                            from this interruption to the traffic. It was officially estimated that
                            the barricade would only last for three days, but it continued from the
                            3rd October until Monday last, when the work was practically finished.
                            The labourers did their best to prolong the job, and the interests of
                            the merchants and the retail traders in the neighbourhood have suffered
                            very greatly. </p>

                        <p>A HINT TO TRAVELLERS.</p>
                        <p>We are on the eve of the season, and all the steamers going East are
                            depositing passengers booked for Egypt and the Nile. Some of these are
                            visiting this country for the first time, others are old habitués, among
                            whom are several who are coming to visit the country again after the
                            lapse of many years. The following information will doubtless be of
                            service to many of these. </p>
                        <p>Society people who come for social pleasures, and who soon tire of
                            Egyptology and sight- seeing, will find one of the new hotels,
                            luxuriously built and equipped to meet all modern requirements (such as
                            the Savoy, Ghezireh Palace, the Continental, or Shepheard's) will afford
                            them a comfortable resting place. But there is another section of the
                            community to be reckoned with and provided for. It is composed of people
                            who are travellers in the true sense; whose object in visiting Cairo is
                            to see all the objects of antique interest-not at a breakneck pace and
                            because they must "get through,"-but in their own way, and who con-
                            template during the winter a long series of lei- surely and reverent
                            ruminations amid the actual scenes made familiar to them in the course
                            of laborious study. Such persons would find the fashionable life and
                            circumstances of the large hotels distinctly distasteful, not to say
                            jarring. But the scientific traveller and studious person is not
                            uncatered for; the Hotel du Nil has always been his headquarters and
                            remains his proper "locale." </p>
                        <p>It may very probably be news to many who have thought they knew Cairo,
                            that the Hotel du Nil stands 3 metres higher than the Esbekich and the
                            hotels in that quarter. The house is an irregular square in Moorish
                            architecture. Its picturesque character may be taken for granted when it
                            is said that the bedrooms, of which there are 100, open on to verandahs
                            on the ground floor, and on the first floor on to a charming balcony
                            which runs round two of the inner sides of the courtyard. The aspect of
                            the hotel is full South, and its position is sheltered. Moreover, the
                            building has none of the heavy character which is given by much marble,
                            even when it is white in colour. </p>
                        <p>One has greater warmth, therefore, during the winter at the Hotel du Nil
                            than when lo cated elsewhere in Cairo. One terrace only is marble-paved,
                            and on this the person who wishes a quiet sun-bath may sit and study
                            removed from all the sounds of the town, while) in the middle of it, and
                            commanding a six-acre extent of open ground, is the garden of the Grand
                            Moofty. The observatory tower on the highest terrace commands a most
                            magnificent view. The hole of the city to its farthest circumference
                            (for the Hotel du Nil occupies its mathematical centre) is spread around
                            on all sides. The slender minaret of the Mosque Adi Yehish is the
                            beautiful object close at hand that one notices against the blue sky, in
                            this air,which is certainly as fresh as any inCairo. The Mohamed Aly
                            Mosquestands out well on the city's edge with the Mokattam Hills in the
                            rear, and the Pyramids of Ghizreh and even of Sakarah are comprehended
                            also in the wonderful view. The entrance is on the Khalig, a new, broad
                            roadway opening out from the Mousky; the dining room has windows on
                            three sides, there are two coffee-rooms, and three pleasant salons where
                            refuge and coolness from the midday sunshine and glare of the terrace is
                            acceptable. Breakfast and tea, and in fact any meal at the pleasure of
                            visitors, may be taken in the kiosks in the courtyard, where bananas,
                            date palms, and a banyan afford a green repose for the eyes. The hotel
                            has a dark-room for photographers, a billiard room and bar, bath rooms,
                            and an additional room which is fitted with a very complete douche
                            apparatus. The manage- ment and cooking at the Hotel du Nil are
                            excellent, and the major domo is one of the best-known and most
                            respected men in Cairo, always most successful in making his guests
                            happy and comfortable. </p>
                        <p>In the early days of the Hotel du Nil, Cairo had no Ismailia, no
                            Tewfikieh, no Doabara quarters. It was Mousky, Mousky, and always
                            Mousky, and for the whole of one's sojourn in Cairo then, as now at the.
                            Nil, whether in the house or out of it, one felt one's self to be really
                            in the East. A foreigner who was com paring his impressions of some
                            European cities the other day was heard to say, "London it is grand,
                            Paris it is magnifique, but Gothenburg- I like it In the same way the
                            verdict of many old habitués of Egypt who come again and again to stay
                            in Cairo is-Shepheard's it is grand, the Savoy it is magnificent, but
                            the Hotel du Nil-I like it.</p>

                            present I compare our meetings to a friendly social gathering. 4 p.m. is
                            the nominal hour, but those who trouble themselves to be punctual may
                            just wait till a sufficient number to form a quorum saunter in,
                            sometimes this is from 30 to 45 minutes, others after an hour waiting.
                            As yesterday, those who have now wasted their whole afternoon are
                            allowed to go, being total no quorum come again Monday. If the Process
