                    <head>LORD MILNER.</head>
                    <p>Lord Milner has received many flattering proofs since his return to England
                        of the regard in which he is held by his fellow-countrymen. They have not
                        forgotten, and they will not forgot, his inestimable services to the Empire,
                        and they have testified their admiration by presenting him with an address,
                        · which both for the number and the quality of</p>
                    <p>its signatures is without a parallel in political history. The paltry and
                        spiteful attempt which was made to get the House of Commons to pass an
                        oblique vote of censure upon him simply excited the scorn of all honourable
                        men throughout the Empire, and we do not doubt that it helped to ensure the
                        success of the address from the Cape Colony which was presented to Lord
                        Milner last week An influential deputation came all the way from South
                        Africa to assure him that twenty-five thousand signatories in the Cape
                        Colony alone are true to the great principles for which he worked
                        unflinchingly in face of the most for. midable obstacles, those principles
                        being “the gradual fusion of the white races of South Africa into one
                        nation, and the retention of that nation as a permanent member of the
                        British group of States." Sir Lewis Michell said that he had never found him
                        other than "calm and collected and inflexibly resolute to see that by no act
                        of his the British flag should be trailed in the dust." Lord Milner no
                        longer holds any official position ; his influence consists solely of the
                        weight which attaches to the opinions expressed in his speeches, and their
                        general tenor conveys a</p>
                    <p><cb/></p>
                    <p>grave warning. From his place in the House of Lords he has delivered at least
                        two most important speeches, the first soon after he took his place in that
                        Assembly, the latter as recently as July 31, when the Government announced
                        the terms on which they had decided to grant a Constitution to the
                        Transvaal. Some people, it is well known, take pleasure in prophesying evil;
                        the raven's croak in their natural voice. It is not so, however, with Lord
                        Milner If he had been a pessimist he could never have lived through the
                        arduous year. from 1898 to 1904, and kept the firm faith which he always
                        professed in the future of South Africa. It would be much more gratifying to
                        him to believe that things were going well as, indeed, they were, until this
                        Govern. ment came into power and started their policy of meddling and
                        muddling in South African. affairg-in Natal as in the Transvaal. Lord Milner
                        devoted most of his speech yesterday not to any specific act of the
                        Government, such as the new Constitution, nor yet to any of the great
                        problems of South Africa in which British interests have been jeopardised by
                        those who now have the deciding voice at home. He holds that the most
                        pressing dánger of the moment in South Africa is disunion among the British
                        Colonists, who seem ready on the very eve of the first electoral trial of
                        strength to split into groups over merely personal differences, in face of a
                        united Dutch party, which preaches incessantly a Dutch South Africa. But the
                        danger of the moment at home is even greater, for it is the growth of what
                        Lord Milner called the spirit of antinationalism. This is a subject to which
                        we have often referred in these columns, since it is constantly breaking out
                        in new forms and varieties, the only constant symptom being the inveterate
                        belief that in any political quarrel one's own countrymen must be in the
                        wrong.</p>
                    <p>An Englishman has only to cross the seas, and in the view of those who suffer
                        from this strange "disease of opinion” he changes his nature as well as his
                        sky. With the mind of the pro-Boer during the war everyone was painfully
                        familiar. In some the malady reached the stage of delirium, and drove them
                        to say that, the Boer cause triumphed, they would he to reconsider their
                        belief in Providence. Perhaps the policy of the present Government may spare
                        them such reconsidera. tion, if they have not already performed that mental
                        exercise, for to give away what we have won by hard fighting and vast
                        sacrifices seems to be the ambition of a powerful section of Ministers. Lord
                        Milner spoke of the extraordinary venom which is displayed against any South
                        African who takes the British side in the conflict between British and Dutch
                        ideals, between what was Milnerism and what Krug ism. The Little Englanders
                        condemn him one who must be “animated by the meant sentiments, a tool of
                        capitalists, a soulle, subservient creature, who can have no higher motive
                        than the greed of gold." These are of the same kidney as the pessimists
                        against whom the German Emperor was moved to lift up his voice in strong
                        irritation a week or two ago, when he lamented that they would not relieve
                        the unfortunate Fatherland of their presence. But the German
                        anti-nationalists are tyros compared with the British. Ours are quite
                        unapproachable for their mischievous persistence. How they filled the air
                        with falsehoods about Chinese slavery is notorious --that was perhaps, their
                        greatest achieve ment, for it was a masterpiece of mendacious hypocrisy.
                        Then a pro-Zulu agitation was started, which would have swollen to ten times
                        its dimensions had a Unionist Government been in power, and the
                        anti-nationalist Press grew eloquent over hypothetical outrages. The outcry
                        against the punishment of the Egyptian villagers who set upon and murdered
                        some British officers has hardly yet died away. Lord Cromer's measured
                        warning to the Home Government of the growth of a fanatic anti-British
                        agitation in Egypt is either derided by these "anti-nationalists” or it is
                        accepted as natural and worthy of all sympathy. The wrongs of India, again,
                        are wringing their bosoms. Englishmen are accused of bleeding India tɔ death
                        and of intensifying the poverty of her poorest classes. The Bengali
                        agitators find ready champions here at home. Their seditious songs are
                        carefully explained away as harmless ebullitions by a small but pertinacious
                        group of Anglo-Indians, whose patronage of the Congress movement, and
                        tolerance of the Swadeshi agitation, bid fair to cause really serious
                        trouble in Bengal, where the success of their noisy clamour has alarmed the
                        great Mohammedan section of the population. We do not believe that this
                        antinationalism, as Lord Milner calls it, is popular with the mass of
                        Englishmen, but it is unquestionably popular with the Radical pulpiteer, and
                        with the Trade Union leaders, who are, for the most part, strongly
                        anti-Imperialist. They carry their followers with them much further than the
                        latter wish to go, and they do so the more light-heartedly, because of their
                        exceedingly limited acquaintance with the affairs of any part of the Empire
                        but their own. There will, as Lord Milner said, be a "tremendous rally" when
                        these pernicious doctrines are pushed too || far; but before the rally
                        comes, mischief may be done which can only be eradicated very slowly and at
                        enormous cost.</p>

                        Turkish garrison of Kusaima contained in our special service telogram of the
                        1st inst. We hear that Kusaima is well supplied with water, three springs,
                        each of which gives birth to a small stream, affording a constant Supply to
                        the Bedouins of the district. An excellent well was found at El Adjs by the
                        frontier commi-sion in the neighbourhood of the ruins of an ancient castle
                        constructed by the Crusaders to check Saracen raide. Several crosses were
                        out in the walls of a rained chapel and fragments of a Greek inscription,
                        dating perhaps from Byzantine timer, in which the word "eteleatėsan" (they)
                        'died' could be deciphered. </p>
                    <p>The Bedouin raiders mentioned in our last issue are described as well armed
                        and equipped. They had martinis, swords, daggers, and pistols, and every man
                        was accompanied by a spare camel. Their dress and appearance was very
                        different from that of most of the Bedouins on the Egyptian side of the
                        frontier, and while the latter are in general poorly armed and equipped, the
                        raiding party which Mr. Keeling encountered constituted a formidable
                        fighting force of about 110 men. It appears to have been composed of
                        contingents from the Ibn Jozi, Turkish Barakat, and another tribe, and its
                        object was the Hiwawat olan with which the Arabs on the Ottoman side of the
                        frontier have a feud.</p>

                    <p>The New Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria has been undergoing a complete
                        transformation during the summer months. and in a very short space of time
                        this magnificent hotel will be completely finished. During the past year
                        seventy-one new bedrooms, four bathrooms and other offices have been added
                        and there are now one hundred and forty bedrooms. The new electric lift, by
                        Stigler of Milan, goss, up to the top stories, and on the terrace of the
                        third floor a large steam laundry has been set up. One of the greatest
                        improvements has been the entire alteration of the kitchen arrangement.
                        Hitherto the service was most awkward owing to the kitchen being situated
                        ten minutes from the dining rooms. Now the old bar has been done away with,
                        and part of it has been converted into an entrance to the kitchen which is
                        now only two minutes from the restaurant. The remaining portion of the old
                        bar has been turned into a couriers' dining room and the new bar has been
                        placed on the original site of the hotel bar on the side facing the Zizinia
                        Theatre. The new bed. rooms have been furnished throughout by Maple and are
                        got op most artistically. All the wallpapers have been chosen with the
                        greatest care and no paint has been spared to adorn each room with all the
                        resourcer of European civilisation. On the 15th inst. the last workman will
                        leave the hotel and the final touches are now being given to the grillroom,
                        which is to take the place of the old terrace. The services of a first-class
                        English cook have been engaged for the grill room, which will be used
                        especially for gappers. A barman from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel at New York
                        is arriving next week for the American bar. All the rooms of the hotel have
                        been retained beforehand and every room will be engaged by the end of
                        October. Seventy rooms are already taken for the 20 h inst. Mr. Frank

                    <head>EXCAVATION OF SAINT MENAS.</head>
                    <p>The recent wonderful discovery of the long lost city of Saint Monas in the
                        wilds of the Mariont desert has aroused great interest throughout
                        enlightened Barope, for although it was known that this ancient city did
                        exist, and that its site was only a few miles from Alexandria, all attempts
                        to discover the whereabouts had been fruitless. Before the Christian Era the
                        city had been a central point for the trade and caravan routes from
                        Alexandria to Cyrene and the Oasig of Ammon and from central Egypt to the
                        North West, but it is chiefly known to fame for the extraordinary sanctity,
                        which it subsequently obtained owing to the execution of Mena, an officer in
                        the army, son of &amp; Governor of a province of Afrioa, who suffered
                        martyrdom under Diocletian. His body was buried there and a Church was built
                        to mark the spot. At the end of the fourth century a magnificent basilica
                        was erected in the reign of Arcading and became a great resting place for
                        pilgrims and travellers on their way from Alexandria to Nitria. A
                        description is extant by an Arab geographer, who describes the Church of St.
                        Mona as still standing, apparently, in an uninjured condition.</p>
                    <p>The date at which this description should be placed is probably between the
                        early part of the eleventh and the early part of the fourteenth century,
                        i.e. subsequent to the great destruction of churches in Egypt by the Caliph
                        Hakim, when thirty thousand churches are said to have been ruined in Syria
                        and Egypt. Since that date the old city has utterly disappeared from history
                        and BirMassie Blomfield in the Bulletin of the Alexandria Arobæɔlogical
                        Society for 1904 stated that it is believed that the site was known to the
                        Bedouins, and he added :</p>
                    <p>"It seems to me that the identification of this site with the assistance of
                        the Coast Guard authorities would be a suitable one on which to expend some
                        portion of the funds of the Arcbæological Society.” But the honour of the
                        discovery of this long-lost city belongs to two German Archæologists, the
                        Rev. O. M. Kaufmann and Mr. J.C.E. Falls who alighted on the rains on Jane
                        7, 1905. They have now compiled an account of their excavations during their
                        first campaign, from November, 1905, to Jane, 1906. The work has just been
                        published at Cairo, and is on sale at Diemer's Library (78. 6d.). It is well
                        printed and illustrated with 54 autotypes, which give the reader an
                        excellent idea of the comprehensive character of the work of excavation and
                        of the many and various artistic finds that have been the outcome of these
                        excavations. This book, which is dedicated by the authors to Schiess Pasbe,
                        gives a most interesting account of the discovery of one of the greatest
                        arobæological mysteries in Egypt, and should be read by all who take an
                        intelligent interest in the ancient history of this country. The record of
                        their work is carried on until last Jone. Since then the Rev. O. M. Kaofmann
                        and Mr. Falls have excavated the buildings connected with the basilica of
                        Arcadias, the principal baptistry of the city, a part of the north cemetery
                        with its basilica, and a small track of the recently discovered south
                        cemetery. Work is now being carried on in the ancient Koinobion. In Menas
                        City all the principal buildings and churches are several metres underground
                        and the work is of greatly difficulty. Some fifty cisterne have been
                        discovered, and some of these have been excavated. For centuries no water
                        has been obtainable at Karm Aba Mina, except daring the winter months, and
                        the water has to be supplied by a camel caravan from a village four miles
                        away.</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir, In "The Times” of the 18th ult. a letter appeared under the
                        heading, "The Situation in Egypt'' signed by "Phylax” which contained the
                        following passage :--</p>
                    <p>"A new journal belonging to the National party has made its appearance ander
                        the name</p>
                    <p>of the "Minbar," or "Palpit," whose opening statement that although holding

                        tone-a dangerous one. It is now engaged</p>
                    <p>in attacking Lord Cromer, and discusses his probable recall with a wealth of

                        claim equality on the score of veracity with the 'Lewa' itself." </p>
                    <p>As the statements of "Phylax” are erroneous, and not only calculated to
                        create a false impression amongst those of your com| patriots who are
                        unacquainted with arabio, but aleo to do harm to the Cango we desire to
                        serve, might I crave the hospitality of your columns in order to place
                        matters in their true light?</p>
                    <p>"Al Minbar” was started a fow months ago by Mohamed Massoud Effendi and
                        myself, with results which are already gratifying to us both-its sole
                        proprietors. The policy of our paper, from its inception, has been one of
                        complete independence. We are under no bond or obligation to anyone, nor has
                        any Power or Party the right to dictate to us the politioaľ views which they
                        seek to propagate. Whilst laying no claim to infallibility, our purpose is
                        to uphold the cause of justice, liberty and equality, to expose abuses and
                        to lead our countrymen along the path of progress and enlightenment. In this
                        sense, and in this sense alone, we are Nationaliste. We are likewise, and
                        for similar reasons, Pan-Islamists.</p>
                    <p>Pan-Islamism we regard as a potent social force linking together and rallying
                        onder one standard of cooperation the various communities of Mohamedans
                        scattered throughout the world, so that by cooperation they may unitedly
                        assert their rightful claims amongst the nations of whom they are subjects.
                        I know it has been alleged that therein lurks a danger to Christendom. I
                        grant that in the hands of unscrupulous and interested sectaries such may be
                        the case. Bot "Al Minbar" never has, and so long as it remains ander its
                        present management, never will support a selfish war of creeds or races.</p>
                    <p>My studies in English history and politics would have availed me little had I
                        not imbibed therefrom something of the Englishman's sense of order. Our
                        paper, "The Tribune," as its name implies, is intended to be the organ of
                        the people, to voice their legitimate aspirations and to ventilate their
                        real grievances ; and I should like to know what fair-minded Englishman
                        would blame as for that or find danger in espousing each a noble cause.
                        Criticism, be it. ever so honest, when ad verse is rarely relished. by those
                        against whom it is directed. But criticism is as the breath of its nostrils
                        to the pablio Press, and provided that personalities are not indulged in and
                        bias excluded, nothing could be more salutary. Egypt especially needs it,
                        for the Press in this country is the solo channel whereby pablic opinion can
                        find expression and be justly gauged. Let me, finally, assure yoo, Sir, and
                        those of your readers who deign to peruse these lines that we have no axe to
                        grind, no personal ambition to gratify, save that of rendering disinterested

                        was known to be in an unseaworthy condition by reason of a partial

                        of the description, I maint ought to be declared null and void on ground of
                        public policy, aye, for the sak humanity. Ships can be ignored, sometime
                        they are over ignored, at, least Mr. Ch berlain used to tell os i the old
                        days. If ship goes down the lost is merely a monete one. But in the event of
                        loss of life, em though each lives may be insured, can it said that any
                        monetary indemnity can regarded as an adequate solution ? If any time clause
                        exists such as I have suggested it ought to be cancelled forthwith by all
                        civilized governments for this alternative of endangering that most precious
                        and irreparable of all possessions -dear human life-or committing a breach
                        of contract entailing upon a mais steamship Co. Heavy penalties in a
                        temptation which a Captain may not be always able to resist and it is
                        certainly one which should never be placed in his way.</p>
                    <p>In the above observations I have said nothing about the inconvenience which a
                        delay of mails occasions to the business community of Egypt,let alone all
                        the other farther east. This though important, is a consideration of minor
                        moment to those I have argued. At the same time might it not be possible for
                        a Co. like the P. &amp; O. to have two ships ready to carry the mails from
                        Brindisi to Port Said and vice versa so as thus to minimise the chances of
                        delay ! </p>
