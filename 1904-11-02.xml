                        <p>Beautiful weather prevailed yesterday until 8 p.m., when there were vivid
                            flashes of lightning in the N.W. and every appearance of an approaching
                            storm. At 8.45 p.m. the weather became squally, with a moderate gale
                            from the N.W. and a rising sea. A heavy shower of rain fell accompanied
                            by heavy peals of thunder and vivid lightning. About midnight there was
                            a flat calm and lightning was seen to the N.E. At 3 a.m. the weather
                            became squally again from the N.W., blowing a moderate gale at times.
                            There was a rough sea, vivid lightning, and frequent heavy showers, the
                            total rainfall being 0.06. The barometer remained steady throughout.</p>

                    <head>REDUCTION OF THE GARRISON.</head>
                    <p>The correspondence which has been filling our cloumns of late on the subject
                        of the reduction of the Army of Occupation is interesting as being in a
                        certain sense a criterion of that somewhat elusive social phenomenon,
                        English public opinion in Egypt. None of the letters, which have appeared
                        from the malcontents, have induced us to depart in the slightest degree from
                        the opinions expressed in our leading article of Saturday week. The
                        statements advanced by this section of our correspondents merit examination
                        in order that the fallacies underlying them may be exposed. It is suggested
                        by both "A Humble Imperialist" and "Old Officer," whose letters appeared in
                        our issues of the 24th and 28th ulto. respectively, that those responsible
                        for the reduction of the garrison are sacrificing military efficiency to
                        electioneering tactics. This is, indeed, a grave allegation. Let us examine,
                        then, the terms in which it is formulated and the grounds upon which it is
                        based. "A Humble Imperialist" writes:– <cb n="6"/>"The wrost thing for the
                        Empire is an Imperial Defence Committee presided over by a party man like
                        the Prime Minister, who would be tempted to put the exigencies of party
                        finance before the true needs of the Empire." In the letter of "Old Soldier"
                        the charge is reiterated with greater particularity. Economy, he tells us,
                        is to-day a more alluring bait to dangle before the British tax-payer – and
                        voter – than efficiency. "To reduce expenses by disbanding some regiments in
                        Great Britain would not appeal much to the man in the street. But to
                        increase the home garrison and at the same time decrease expense, is a
                        valuable electioneering asset. For it mustbe borne in mind that any military
                        unit is less in numbers and cheaper to maintain in England than abroad; en
                        parenthese, it is also less efficient." We have quoted textually the words
                        used by our correspondents in order that it may not be said that we have
                        unfairly represented them. Both writers must be taken to know the facts upon
                        which they evince in the controversy, it must likewise be assumed that they
                        have perused the correspondence which had previously appeared in our
                        columns. Now, we would take leave to inquire for what reason thses gentlemen
                        have thought fir to gloss over a most important factor in this discussion,
                        viz., that Egypt contributes to the maintenance of the British Army of
                        Occupation. It was stated by "An Occasional Correspondent" in our issue of
                        the 22nd ulto. that 84,000 is the annual contribution. We have been at pains
                        to cinsult the estimates for 1904, and we find that the actual amount, as
                        given in the "Stateman's Year Book," is L.E. 84,825. "An Occasional
                        Correspondent," therefore, errs on the right side. It follows, then, as a
                        necessary consequence, that by the withdrawal of 1,800 troops the burden
                        upon the Egyptian Exchequer will be proportionatrly lightened, whilst that
                        upon the British Exchequer will be, caeteris paribus, to an equal extent
                        increased. Where, then is the economy which is to appeal so powerfully to
                        the pockets of the British taxpayer – and voter? "Old Soldier" attempts to
                        bolster up his contention thuswise. "It is cheaper," he says, "to maintain
                        soldiers in England than abroad." Let him prove it. We will not dispute with
                        him on that point because we are without the necessary knowledge, but after
                        what he has written we are not prepared to accept his ipse dixit as
                        conclusive. Let him substantiate, the actual saving to the British Treasury
                        that will be effected by the reduction of the garrison. That is what he has
                        to do to establish this branch of his argument. If he cannot do that, we
                        would recommend him to be more careful in future over his facts before he
                        attributes "unworthy" motives to any amn, least of all to the Government by
                        which he is, or was, employed.</p>
                    <p>We further notice a minor error into which he has fallen but which, all the
                        same, goes to emphasize his general unreliability. He refers to "some two
                        and a half years ago, when the British barracks at Khartoum were finished, a
                        British regiment was needed to garrison that salubrious spot. It was not
                        found possible to spare one from Egypt and one was brought from outside,
                        thus increasing the Army of Occupation by one regiment." Surely, "Old
                        Officer," whose Imperialist solicitude is so over-mastering that he must
                        needs give it vent by censuring in the public Press his present or former
                        superiors, ought to be aware that the Suden is held jointly by the British
                        and Egyptian Governments, and that, therefore, there can be no question of a
                        British Army of Occupation in the sense that the term is understood in
                        Egypt. The further point that both "A Humble Imperialist" and "Old Soldier"
                        endeavour to make only tends to obscure the issue without advancing bu one
                        iota their own contention. They ask us to believe without a title of
                        evidence that this one was out-voted and that would launch us upon a sea of
                        conflicting suppositions. And here we must enter our protest against such a
                        method of canvassing official opinions from which one may happen to dissent.
                        Nothing could be more mischievous than to attempt to impugn the decision of
                        the authorities by the insidious suggestion, based admittedly upon pure
                        surmise, that they were not in agreement, but that military counsels were
                        over-ridden by party considerations. We prefer, and we trust that we shall
                        carry the majority of our readers with us, to credit our Imperial Defence
                        Committee with honourable intentions and patriotic conduct, rather than to
                        suspect its members, without a shred of proof, of being traitorous political
                        time servers.</p>

                    <p>Tantah, Tuesday.– Bishop Morley arrived here yesterday evening and held a
                        service at 7.30 p.m. and this morning at 8.30 a.m. in the church-room. Both
                        services were largely attended.</p>

                    <head>SCARCITY OF SILVER.</head>
                    <p>Although the cotton season here this year is very late and poor, our
                        Moudirieh is already without silver. One wonders what it would have been if
                        the season had turned out a good one. Since last spring I have been hearing
                        of large consignments of silver arriving from England and Germany. Where has
                        it all gone to? The Government should see that an ample supply is provided
                        for the public'c requirements. I presume we shall soon see the "sarrafs"
                        charging P.T. 2 or P.T. 3 for changing a soversign, as last year.</p>

                    <head>MOTOR TRACTION FOR CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:– I notice in the Gazette of this evening an
                        interesting paragraph on the subject of motor omnibuses for Cairo. I learn
                        on very good authority that the Egyptian Government would be very pleased to
                        entertain any proposition for such an innovation. The present progress of
                        Cairo demands an efficient omnibus service. The Capital is increasing in all
                        diractions. The traffic is enormous to what it was in recent years. The
                        other day I counted 103 carriages crossing Kasr-el-Nil Bridge, returning
                        from the promenade, in only seven minutes. From enquiries I have made I
                        learn that this is a dailt occurrence. The introduction of motors both for
                        omnibus and transport purposes would greatly alleviate the present pressure
                        and also prevent much unnecessary cruelty to animals. There is no better
                        managed society than the S.P.C.A. of Cairo, the infirmary of which I learn
                        well repay a visit, but from what I learn the S.P.C.A. is powerless in the
                        great majority of cases to effect any remedy owing to the Capitulations. I
                        think a word of praise is due to the police for the admirable way in which
                        they control the trafic in Cairo, including that of the motor cars, which in
                        European cities are so difficult to deal with. Judging from this I should
                        say that the introduction of motor omnibuses would in no way prove an
                        additional source of ambarasment to the police or danger to the public.</p>

                    <head>OBJECT OF THE PATROL.</head>
                    <p>As very exaggerated reports have recently appeared in the British Press as to
                        the proposed despatch of a patropl into the Southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, it is
                        desirable that the correct facts should be made public.</p>
                    <p>This measure was decided upon a year ago, the object in view being the
                        establishment of certain necessary Government posts and the further
                        settlement of the country.</p>
                    <p>It is hoed that no resistance will be offered, but the patrol is strong
                        enough to deal with any of the more turbulent chiefs, should they prove
                        hostile.</p>
                    <p>The numbers and scope of the patrol are seriously misstated in the Press
                        reports. The present is by no means the first patrol which has been
                        despatched, such minor operations having been frequently undertaken in order
                        to establish the Government, and rather to prevent the outbreak of
                        hostilities by a timely display of strength than to provoke any collision
                        with the local tribes.</p>

                        Sublime Porte his opposition to the continuation of the railway to Mecca. At
                        most he agrees to the line being prolonged to Medina. On the other hand, the
                        line will not be extended beyond Maan in the meantime. From this last point
                        a branch is to be constructed to join the Akaba Gulf. If this plan be
                        carried out Turkey will possess an open door to Egypt. England is not likely
                        to accept such a solution without reluctance, and will probably seek for
                        compensation in Yemen or in the Hedjaz.</p>

                        stone's throw of Shepheard's Hotel is still continued almost nightly, and,
                        naturally, with the same inevitable result of finding no gamblers nor
                        gambling, for as soon as Captain quartier, the chief of the secret police
                        service, accompanied by the kawass of the Hellenic Consulate, is seen

                    <p>Both we and our confreres in the Capital have, at different periods, called

                        months ago regarding this matter there would have been a change. Instead of
                        this, however, we find that the largest of these gambling-dens, after
                        remaining closed for a few weeks, has reopened its doors and is frequented

                        interpretation of the opers was very good, especially as regards the
                        orchestra and the female choruses, some of the members of which possess very
                        fresh voices. The tenor Zonghi sang well, more especially in the famous
                        romance in the 3rd act. The baritone Badini and the comic bass Bordogni were
                        excellent, while the light soprano at time distinguished herself. The opera
                        did not attract a large audience; it is too old to please modern tastes. The
                        music is spiritless, and the development of the piece is based on the
                        conventional. The sweet and spirited melody which distinguished Donizetti's
                        other operas is somewhat lacking here.</p>

                        Egyptian agriculture is in a hopeless state of disorganisation owing to
                        there being no real head. At the present time the Government is creating new
                        official posts and is increasing the slalries of the more favoured
                        officials, but there is no sign that any of the surplus funds now placed at
                        the disposal of the authorities will be devoted to the creation of an
                        Agricultural Department. If we want any agricultural statistics we have to
                        go to the Alexandria General Produce Association's reports. Yet it would be
                        quite easy to organise such a Department, for we have many excellent men who
                        could be selected for the position of chief of the Department. Mr. Foster,
                        the managing director of the Behera Company, would be an ideal man for the
                        job. His great experience in the service of the Egyptian Government, and his
                        achievements as director of the fortunes of the Behera Company, are
                        sufficient qualifications. Again, there is Mr. Lang Anderson, the managing
                        director of the Aboakir Company. His success as a most capable and energetic
                        agriculturist is known throughout the length and breadth of Egypt. Mr.
                        Foaden, the able secretary of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, would be a
                        very suitable sub-director of the new Department, owing to his techincal
                        knowledge. The newly-appointed chemist to the Agricultural Society, Mr.
                        Hughes, and the entomologist, Mr. Willcocks, would be useful men on the
                        staff. Mr. Monson would also have been a good man for the staff, but as he
                        is devoting hinself to his own syndicate his services are not available.
                        There are, however, other names, which I could suggest, but I do not wish to
                        trespass at two great length on your valuable space. One of the first duties
                        of such a Department would be to infuse new life into the School of
                        Agriculture at Ghizeh, which is doing very little good at present time. The
                        Veterinary Department is greatly handicapped at the present time owing to
                        its connection with the Sanitary Administration. If placed under a
                        Department of Agriculture its uses would be developed many times over. In
                        fact, the capacity for good, which such a Department would possess, will be
                        incalculable, and the sooner such an administration is created, the better
                        it will be for Egypt.</p>
