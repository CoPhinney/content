                            for the twelve months, the same as in previous years. This will leave a

                        <p>We have received photographs of crops of grain, sown in autumn last at
                            the Deir in Khargeb, on a plot of land, five or six acres in area,
                            belonging to the Corporation of Western Egypt. The crops, which consist
                            of wheat and barley, look excellent, and were respectively reaped on
                            April 16 and March 31 ultimo, What is phenomenal about this land is its
                            marvellous fertility; there are positive proofs to show that the land
                            has lain fallow since Ptolemy, 2,000 years ago, and yet despite the fact
                            that not an ounce of manure was used, it has after this lapse of time
                            yielded an excellent crop of wheat. The fact is worthy of a place in
                            Egypt's history. </p>

                        <head>To Abolish the Egyptian Mosquito.</head>
                        <p>The canals and birkets in Egypt are great breeding grounds for the
                            mosquito and it is of interest to hear of a West Indian method of
                            extermination which could be introduced into this country. In the
                            Barbadoes many of the waters abound in a small fish known as "millions"
                            -presumably from their great numbers - which feeds on the larvæ of the
                            mosquito. It is said that in the parts where the fish abounds there is
                            immunity from mosquitoes, and that malaria is almost unknown.
                            Experiments are to be tried by introducing the fish into other islands
                            of the West Indies. This plan of introducing a natural enemy has proved
                            successful in a number of cases, and the mosquito-eating fish might be
                            introduced into other districts. If this fish really feeds largely on
                            the larvæ of the mosquito, and if the latter have really become extinct
                            in the district, we have the unusual case of species exterminating its
                            own food supply. </p>

                    <p>BANQUET IN LONDON.</p>
                    <p>THE NATION AND ITS SERVANTS.</p>
                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service).</p>
                    <p>LONDON, Saturday. </p>
                    <p>The banquet, which was appropriately held on the evening of "Empire Day," in
                        honour of Lord Milner, was a magnificent, while not excessive, tribute to a
                        great career. Mr. Chamberlain, who was in the chair, made a great speech in
                        which he pointed out that Lord Milner and such as he sought not popular
                        applause but were content to leave the judgement of their work to posterity.
                        He said that Lord Milner, far from being poor, was opulent in the only kind
                        of wealth which he valued, namely, the esteem and respect of a great body of
                        the nation, and, far from being powerless, he was only awaiting the time
                        when his services would again be required. Meanwhile, he was one of the
                        Empire's great assets.</p>
                    <p>Lord Milner met with an enthusiastic reception on rising to make his reply,
                        which was modest and rightly conceived. He said he believed that it was
                        characteristic of the British nation, despite the exigencies of party, to
                        deal with its servants in a spirit of broad generosity, and whilst not
                        demonstrative in recognising their faithful services, did not go to the
                        other extreme of noting small things done amiss but rather dealt with the
                        merits of their service as a whole.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Suez Thursday. </p>
                    <p>H.H. cruiser Nour-el-Bahr sailed from Suez at noon to-day for Akaba with the
                        Egyptian boundary commissioners.</p>
                    <p>As advised you yesterday, the cruisers Fox and Perseus sailed for Aden
                        yesterday afternoon. They are bound to the Persian Gulf.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Diana, which has played a prominent part at Akaba, entered the Canal
                        at 8 o'clock this morning bound to Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Diana arrived at Alexandria early this morning from Suez, and anchored
                        in the outer harbour. Rear-Admiral Lembton, who had been staying at San
                        Stefano, shortly afterwards proceeded in a steam launch to join the vessel,
                        on which his pennant was at once hoisted. The Diana then sailed, presumably
                        for Malta.</p>
                    <p>The Diana bore the burden and heat of the day in the recent frontier dispute,
                        having been sent on a special mission by the Commander in-Chief of the
                        Mediterranean Fleet at the outset of the difficulty, accomplishing a
                        delicate diplomatic mission with success, and to Lord Cromer's satisfaction.
                        Her commanding officer, Captain R. S. Phipps Horoby, though only
                        thirty-nine, has a record of much active work, and has before been engaged
                        on special service in Creta and in Tangier. He also is familiar with
                        Egyptian problems, having served in the Egyptian War in 1882, and is
                        recognised as a promising and able young officer, following well, as
                        opportunity occurs in the steps of his distinguished father.</p>

                    <p>HER ARREST IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>The arrest in Cairo some time back of Fraulein Milewska and the events that
                        led up to it are still occupying the attention of the Berlin law courts.
                        This complicated case of Fraülein Milewska, who was maid of honour to
                        Princess Amalia of Schleswig Holstein, has been occupying the Garman courts
                        for the past six years. It received a further hearing last week.</p>
                    <p>Fraulein Milewska, as has previously been reported, is being tried for
                        extensive embezzlement, and slander of her royal mistress. The case is going
                        against the maid of honour, who in her turn, however, has now brought a suit
                        against Herr von Blumenthal, Chamberlain of the German Kaiser, who effected
                        her arrest in Cairo. She states that in order to have her arrested Herr von
                        Blumenthal made slanderous statements concerning her to the Egyptian
                        authorities, including allegations as to her identity as head of an
                        Anarchist band. Fraulein Milewska also asserts that Herr von Blumenthal
                        falsely represented in Cairo that her arrest was the direct desire of the
                        German Kaiser himself.</p>
                    <p>It was this phase of the case, Fraulein Milewsks's accusations against
                        the-Kaiser's Chamberlain, Herr von Blumenthal, which received a hearing last
                        week. </p>
                    <p>The case was adjourned till further witness can be procured.</p>

                    <p>NEW MARKET WANTED.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port Said Thursday. </p>
                    <p>The local paper "La Vérité” has recently drawn attention to many grievances
                        at Port Said, besides pointing out several abuses in native bazaars, such as
                        unstandardized weights and the insanitary condition of certain districts in
                        the European quarter. Special mention is made of the custom of throwing
                        slops into the street. One resident in Port Said has been known on occasion
                        to carry an umbrella, when there was practically no rain, remarking to
                        facetious enquirers, "What price the slops"! Time after time people just
                        miss being bespattered with dirty dish and other water en passant. The lack
                        of urinals or latrines forbids any interference with those who give offence
                        to the more sensitive passengers unacquainted with native customs. Port Said
                        is practically the only point in Egypt at which passengers en route to and
                        from the East touch, to say nothing of numerous fastidious American
                        tourists. It is a pity such an omission should have been allowed to continue
                        so long. Residents are accustomed to these sights and possibly from the
                        hygienic point of view there is little amiss with the present method of
                        solving the question of sewage disposal.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the bazaar, the provision of a new market built on modern
                        lines for the sale of fish, meat, vegetables and other goods liable to rapid
                        decomposition in our climate would go far to remove the present
                        unsatisfactory state of affairs. </p>
                    <p>Theft of Specie.</p>
                    <p>On the recent arrival of the S.S. Mariont, of the Khedival Mail Line, bound
                        from Yambe, the Captain reported the loss of specie to the amount of £6,000.
                        An enquiry instituted by the Governor in Suez was successful not only in
                        securing the culprits, but also their booty. </p>
                    <p>Tennis Club Dance,</p>
                    <p>On Friday evening the Tennis Club gave a very successful dance in the Eastern
                        Exchange attended by a number of members, their friends, and officers of the
                        Minerva. </p>
                    <p>Man Overboard.</p>
                    <p>In passing through the Canal last week, one of the crew of the East African
                        liner Prinz Regent fell overboard, but was fortunate in being rescued as
                        owing to the storm the ship had to moor at the psychological moment. </p>
                    <p>New Austrian Lloyd Steamers,</p>
                    <p>A contract has been signed by the Austrian Lloyd Co. with the Austrian
                        Government which necessitates the building of new fast steamers of the
                        estimated value of two millions. </p>
                    <p>An Innovation.</p>
                    <p>The custom of painting the name in large letters in the centre of the hull of
                        many foreign ships seems to have recommended itself to at least one English
                        line coming from West Hartlepool. The English custom of inscribing the name
                        at one end of the ship in letters indistinguishable at any distance must
                        often cause inconvenience to people unacquainted with the designation of the
                        ships as represented by the painting of the funnel or the special flag of
                        the company.</p>

                    <p>At the annual general meeting of the above company, which was held in Cairo
                        yesterday, it was decided to distribute a dividend of six and a-half per
                        cent.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the company's land at Boulac, we understand that the area
                        embraces about 8,000 square metres, which, at a very conservative estimate
                        of its total value, should be worth at the very least £50,000.</p>
                    <p>The following is the report of the directors for the past year's working up
                        to the 30th ult.</p>
                    <p>In preparing their sixth annual report and balance sheet the directors,
                        though satisfied that the general business of the company has on the whole
                        been maintained, have felt the absence of any special sources of profit
                        which made last year one of exceptional prosperity and enabled them to
                        declare a larger dividend than usual. A further reduction of profit has to
                        be recorded under the heading of freight : the return on the capital
                        invested in this branch of business has fallen to a point inconsistent with
                        any further reduction in rates. The directors hope that the present tariff
                        may be maintained, but, should the competition in rate cutting be further
                        indulged in, they may be obliged to adopt a policy which, while entailing
                        some temporary loss and inconvenience on their shareholders, will
                        effectively put an end to the practice.</p>
                    <p>Experiments have been made during the past year in the construction and
                        equipment of sailing barges and their employment in river and canal traffic.
                        The great difficulty of controlling native crews whose riverain origin makes
                        them desirous of prolonging, rather than of ending their voyages, is largely
                        responsible for results, which, if not altogether constituting a failure,
                        cannot be regarded as otherwise than a qualified success. The doubt
                        attaching to the outcome of any experiment seems to justify the policy of
                        the directors in refusing to embark in capital expenditure of any magnitude
                        without first assuring themselves, as far as such a thing is possible, that
                        it will be permanently remunerative. It may, and does mean, that a portion
                        of the capital of the company remains unengaged. It is however possible to
                        find temporary remuneration for capital outside the business of the company,
                        and in this connexion the directors are able to point to the successful
                        employment of the reserve fund which has produced a very considerable
                        profit. This fund, which after last year's additions amounted to L.E.
                        12,000, has now been brought up to L.E. 17,000 by the premium derived from
                        the issue of 5,000 shares to the Hamburg-America Line. The investment, as
                        last year, appear in the balance sheet at cost price ; the depreciation on
                        the Crédit Foncier shares is counterbalanced by the appreciation in the
                        value of the Menzaleh shares, but no account has been taken of either. </p>
                    <p>AGREEMENT WITH HAMBURG-AMERICA LINE.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement arrived at with this important Company, of which details were
                        given at the extraordinary general meeting, is one which will, the directors
                        believe, be to the advantage of the shareholders. A considerable economy is
                        expected from the concentration of the European agencies in the hands of the
                        Hamburg-America Line, while the additional tourist traffic which they should
                        secure, should contribute largely to the success of the new steamboats which
                        are to be put on the Nile. There boats are being built in England and will,
                        it is hoped, be ready for the coming tourist season.</p>
                    <p>Want of space in the Company's yard at Boulac and the difficulty of providing
                        in so limited a space an ares both for the requirements of modern and
                        efficient workshops and of a ware-housing depôt, led the directors to seek
                        for a suitable site elsewhere ; the price of land in the near vicinity of
                        Cairo suitable for the purpose is now almost prohibitive, but they are happy
                        to say that they have obtained from the Ministry of Finance a lease of three
                        feddans of land at Shoubra for a period co-extensive with the existence of
                        the company. This site, although somewhat distant, is, nevertheless, well
                        adapted to the company's requirements by virtue of its long trontage on and
                        depth of water in the Nile channel. A considerable outlay will have to be
                        incurred in erecting adequate premises and workshops. The directors,
                        however, hope to be able to provide for this by the sale of a portion of
                        their site at Boulac. After writing off the value of the present workshops
                        and such plant as cannot be removed and making provision for the new
                        premises, it is expected that a considerable surplus will be available. This
                        will be devoted to further strengthening the position of the company by the
                        creation of those special funds without the protection of which no
                        navigation company can be said to be properly safeguarded.</p>
                    <p>The Directors propose to pay a dividend of 6 ½ % and to carry forward a
                        balance of L.E. 1,801,365 m/m. After provision for depreciation and
                        maintenance, there remains to be distributed on this season's working alone,
                        a sum of L.E. 6,847,539 m/m from which the directors propose to pay a
                        dividend of 5% LE. 5,850,000 m/m leaving a balance of

                    <head>THE VICTORIA COLLEGE</head>
                    <p>ITS INCEPTION.</p>
                    <p>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." </p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,--You will excuse the liberty I take in thus writing you these
                        lines, but seeing that H.E. Lord Cromer laid the foundation stone of the New
                        Victoria College yesterday, I thought perhaps you would like to know the
                        history of the first establishing of this school, in which you and every
                        Englishman take such a great interest.</p>
                    <p>By birth I am not an Englishman, but I have been in connection with the
                        Britishers for nearly 50 years, coming amongst them as a boy, and all my
                        thoughts, my interests and feelings are with that race. I am now about 64
                        years of age, and whatever I have, even to my existence, I owe to them, and
                        I do not regret it, because they have treated me always as one of their own
                        countrymen.</p>
                    <p>I was sent out here by the Church of Scotland Mission Society in the year
                        1877, I believe. I began and continued my work earnestly but it was most
                        difficult as there was no English schools everything was foreign. French,
                        Italian and German schools there were, and no one seemed to have any
                        sympathy with the English, who by other nationalities seemed to be hated and
                        despised. The above nationalities taught only their own language in their
                        own schools. Consequently I began to worry the life out of the late lamented
                        Sir Ch. Cookson and the late lamented Canon Davis, of St. Mark's Church for
                        nearly 5 years. These two gentlemen I was so often with them, that I was
                        taken as part and parcel of them, they were great and true friends of mine.
                        I asked them, why don't you get the English Government to build a good
                        English school here, which is so greatly needed ? The reply was that the
                        English Government did not build schools in foreign countries, and told me I
                        should not worry myself to death about the matter, that my heart was too
                        soft, and if I did not take care my head would be the same. I did not care,
                        I thought if the English Government would not help with a day school, I
                        would by the help of my two friends' financial help start a night school. I
                        did, and had over 150 adults and boys. I was obliged to pay English teachers
                        and I asked Professor Alf. Griffen and another Englishman who has since died
                        at Constantinople to come and help me. Syd. H. Carver, Esq.. Judge Lionel
                        Sanders, Sir. Ch. Cookson, apd Canon Davis provided me with the means to pay
                        the teachers and to pay all expenses, which I kept up for over 3 years and
                        it was a great success. In the end I was sorry to give the night school up
                        owing to Sir Ch. Cookson leaving Egypt as the means at my disposal after he
                        left were not sufficient to keep it going.</p>
                    <p>The year before he left though I was so persistent, and not going to be
                        daunted I would not leave the good Sir Charles alone, until I had got by
                        hook or by crook a day school, until in desperation be said, "Well, Rudolph,
                        if you can encourage some rich Jews to take an interest in the school you
                        can have your heart's desire and we will make it a good one." I was
                        delighted. I brought Clement Aghion to Sir Charles Cookson, and we talked
                        the matter over, especially upon finance Clement Aghion got his relative
                        Giuseppe Aghion and Baron Menasce to join, and the Victoria College was
                        first established by Sir Ch. Cookson, Clement Bohor, and Gioseppe Aghion,
                        Baron Menasce, and the late Canon Davis, and I pride myself upon being the
                        originator of the scheme, when I amongst the many others behold the
                        foundation, the corner stone of which H.E. Lord Cromer laid, one of the
                        finest schools in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Professor Alfred Griffen can bear me out and testify to what I have said to
                        be true, with regard to the establishment of the school.-- Believe me,
                        etc.</p>
