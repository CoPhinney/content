                    is situated on the Russian extreme left, the Russians seem to have thwarted al
                    toming movement on a considerable scale. Fighting appears to have been somewhat
                    formidable.</p>
                <p>General Kuropatkin reports on the 29th inst that the retreating Japanese balted 8
                    miles south east of Tsin-khe chou. The inhabitants state that the Japanese were
                    very dospirited, and were carrying many wounded. The Russian artillery and
                    infantry resumed the offensive today, but were received with a heavy fusillade.
                    The fighting is proceeding. All is quiet elsewhere.</p>

                <p>DEPARTURE OF HUSSARS.</p>
                <p>GEN. SLADE BIDS GOOD-BYE.</p>
                <p>The 20th Hussars left Cairo to-day on their way back to England. At 9.30 a.m. the
                    troop train of 22 carriages bearing the regiment to Alexandria steamed into
                    Cairo station from Abbassieh. In spite of the prevailing dull weather, and a
                    persistent drizzle, many friends! of the departing officers and men had gathered
                    on the platform, and as soon as the train stepped, Major General Slade, C.B.,
                    accompanied by the field officers of the Army of Occupation and officers of the
                    Egyptian Army, went for in ward to say "good-bye” to the regiment, the al
                    colonel and officers stepping from the train to bid farewell. The General was
                    loudly cheered by the men. In the meantime an Egyptian Army Band discoursed some
                    selections of music.</p>
                <p>After the leave-takings were over, the offi: oers returned to their carriages,
                    and the train began to steam out, to the strains of "Auld</p>
                <p>Lang Syne" and the sound of the heartiest Labaars in honor of the General Officer
                    Commanding.</p>
                <p>The regiment leaves many friends behind it, and its departure from Cairo is
                    greatly 18 gretted</p>
                <p>The regiment is expected to arrive at-Alexandria at 2.45 p.m. and will at once
                    embark on the Dunera for passage to Sngland.</p>
                <p>The Mounted Military Police and details, which arrived by the Dunera, disembarked
                    early this morning and left for Cairo by troop train at 6.30 8.m.</p>
                <p>BALL AT GENERAL'S HOUSE. On the occasion of the departure of the 20th Hussars, a
                    very successful ball was given by Major-General and Mrs. Slade af General's

            <p>IRRIGATION.</p>
            <p>Medinet el Fayoum, Nov. 29. Mr. Clowes, Inspector of Irrigation, has lett P for
                Wasta.</p>
            <p>The water level in Fake Karoon is now one metre higher than during the past summer.
                The Irrigation Department has just put up &amp; proper gang. Hitherto only a piece
                of woods has been used for the purpose of measurement</p>
            <p>The new canals in the Fayoum desért will increase the cultivable area of the province
                By about 30,000 feddans.</p>
            <p>VISITORS. Messrs. Anderson and Fowler inspected the working steam ploughs used on the
                lands of Prince Mohamed Aly, and which were supplied by them. I understand that
                these ploughs work much better than the American ones now in use in the Fayoum
                province.</p>
            <p>THE CHRISTIAN PERVERT. Many Christian women - want to give up! their religion and
                become Mohamedans for the reason that either they dislike their husbands or are
                disliked by them, and are unable to get this state of things remedied by divorosi
                'In this country it is very easy to become a Mohamedan and obtain the divorce
                required I know many cases of this kind have taken place, not only here, but at
                other places, one of these being that of the Syrian woman to whom you referred in
                last Saturday's paper</p>
            <p>| Yesterday, I met another woman who wants to ne lobange her religion and become a
                follower of</p>
            <p>the Prophet. If Christian priests of various nationalities do not find some way of
                making divorce an easier matter than it is at present; I think that they will lose a
                good many of the members of their churches.</p>
            <p>ENGLISH AND EGYPTIANS. I quite agree with the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net" that
                England has not yet het lopeded in winting the affections of the Arab</p>
            <p>Although Lord Oromer bas dome his best to coneitiate the follahoon, by relieving them
                from</p>
            <p>oppression and mairy other ways, he has not Yet succeeded in gaining thromover and
                inIdeeing them to adopt w more friendly attitude | I to Englisken. There are two
                things to count for this; firstly, difference of religion,</p>
            <p>difficulty of properly understanding each other's manners and customs. It is a fixed
                idea in the minds of the natives of this country that politics and religion and
                inse? parable, and it takes a long time to make them understand that the English are
                not intolerant land do not dislike those who differ from them</p>
            <p>in belief. For myself I believe that an English woman may do more than an Englishman
                in educating native girls, and teaching them to | be timid and womanly. Once taught
                they will teach their children the lesson they themselves have learned.</p>
            <p>THE MUNICIPAL COMMISSION. The meeting of the Alexandria Municipal Commission which
                was to have been held yesterday had to be postponed because of lack of sufficient
                councillors to form a quortm. Only nine councillors put in an appearance. The
                adjourned meeting will be held on Saturday, next.</p>
            <p>There has been no meeting of the Commission since November 2, and yesterday's fiksoo
                shows the extraordinary apathy of the councillors. The following gentlemen were the
                only ones who could find it convenient to perform their self-imposed daty, but owing
                to the slackhess of their fellows, they could transact no business: Sateh Bey

                <p>(PROM OHR FEATURE CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>London, November 25, 1904. We have reason to believe that the pour parlers
                    concerning &amp; dissipation of hostilities in the Far East are continuing, and
                    some progress has been made, although matters she moving more slowly than was
                    boped.</p>
                <p>A significant telegram from St. Petersburg states that "General Kuropatkin has
                    assured the Russian Government that no fighting of importance is likely to our
                    stil the spring." This is all gradually making it all felt in the financial
                    world, and the marked improvements in South Africans during the | past week
                    have, as we anticipated, given a fresh impetus to this class of speculation
                    generally. Egyptian Mining Companies in particular, have been well supported,
                    and shew a further advance in prices. We drew attention some weeks ago to the
                    front that there were signs of a reawakening of interest in this I section, and
                    there has already been considerable rise from the prices then maling Nile
                    Valleys, as foretold, bave oome up during the past fortnight from 1-9/16 to 2,
                    and are now a strong market at the latter prices with every prospect of much
                    higher prices. The parent company, the United African Exploration Co., Lad.,
                    have risen from 14 to 2, and are spoken of as a very promising purchase. We
                    understand that their financial position is very strong and that they have cash
                    in hand considerably more than their total capital of £70,000, added to which
                    they have a large holding of Nite Valley sharen, and are also heavily interest
                    in the Nile Cold Storage Co., which with have been selling at 88/- to 40%- for
                    the £1 share, consequently they should prote sebep purchase at anything like to
                    dhy''pride. Some of the lower-priced shares should also be worth attention, such
                    as Um Rus, Egyptian Mines and Mysore Reefs. The last named are in a thoroughly
                    sound financial position they stand only at 7/. and should be cheap speculative
                    look-up.</p>
                <p>In Egyptian Stocks, Bank shares are very firm, Nationals keeping their price well
                    at 24 and Agricultures at 11. Salt and Soda, though less active for the moment,
                    keep up to 37/6, few, if any sharos, have come on the market Land Shares are
                    somewhat musier, Afture has been the support for Dairs Stigar, which has risen
                    to 6, largely on Paris purobabe. This is based on the failure of the beter and
                    the consequent rise in the finished material</p>
