                </p>
                <p>That the progress of the war between Russis and Japan is being followed with the
                    keenest interest by all educated Egyptians, is a fact evident to all, and
                    nothing can be more natural than that their sympathies should be wholly with the
                    sturdy little Japs, for Russia has always been regarded by Mosleins every where
                    is an inveterate foe, not only of the Ottoman power, but of Islam. Nor does the
                    fact that some fow Moslems have been permitted to rise to high military and
                    other rank under the rule of the Tsar in the least modify this view, for it is
                    noto-1rious that the men thus promoted have been so Russianised that they consed
                    to be Mahomedaus in almost everything but name. But while the majority of the
                    Egyptians are thus keenly anxious for the final triumph of the Japanese without
                    building upon its possibility any anticipations beyond its necessary con
                    sequences, there are some in Egypt, as in some other parts of the East, who are
                    nurturing a vague, but none the loss vigorous, hope that the Japanese armies now
                    in the field are but the advanced guards of a grest Eastern army that is to
                    spring into existence from Do one knows where and wrest from European Powers the
                    world-wide dominion they have esta blished; some who are, in short, dreaming of
                    - Yellow Glory as some little time back some of the panio-mongers of Europe were
                    dreaming of a Yellow Peril.</p>
                <p>Private letters from India tell us that the interest taken there in the war and
                    the intense sympathy for the Japanese bave awakened uneasy feelings among those
                    who believe that India is held by the sword and by the sword only Needless to
                    say that those who know the people better know how far from the truth is such an
                    interpretation of their feelings. But whatever views individuals, wiether
                    Europesesor Basterns, may take of this subject, it is extreme ly desirable that
                    Easterns everywhere should ask themselves the question - How is it that the
                    Japanese have in such a short time raised themselves from the position and
                    condition of oue of the least of the nations to be one of the Powers! The answer
                    to that question is not difficult to find. It lies, in fact, on the very sur
                    face of the history of the war. Great as have been the achievements of the
                    Japanese, there is no mystery or magie about them. They have been the result of
                    forces with which the world is familiar, the forces that made the Roman Empire
                    great, that led Greeks to victory; that have built up the might of the great
                    European Powers - unity of sim and devotion to duty. These are to-day, as they </p>
                <p>have ever been, the forces that make a nation or a people invulnerable and if the
                    East has everywhere been brought under the dominiou of the West it is because
                    the peoples of the East have never possessed these foroes. Mere military might
                    can accomplish but little. It may build up, but by itself it cannot maintain, a
                    great empire. That is why the history of so maay of the empires of the past has
                    been almost as brief as brilliant. And we have yet to learn whether the upward
                    rush of the Japanese is anything more than theirs bas been, though it must be
                    admitted that almost all we have learned of them of late would tend to show that
                    they are indeed in possession of the true empire making forces. For the moment,
                    at all events, they undoubtedly have these forces in &amp; high degree, but
                    whether they have them in a degree that will stand the strain of a great triumph
                    or of a great disaster, is a ques tion yet to be solved. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately for the rest of the East, nothing can be more certain than the
                    utter absence of both the forces named from among their peoples. Throughout all
                    these every man is for huselt. In India alone there are indeed a few who have
                    shown a higher con ception of what a man's duty to his follows is. Elsewhere,
                    creeds, clans, and countries do, it is true, exhibit a certain amount of unity
                    and united action among sections of the Easterns, but it is a unity born rather
                    of hostility to those outside than of amity to those within it, and therefore a
                    unity that in the end is destructive and not constructive, the unity of a bundle
                    of sticks, not the cohesion of a solid mass. If the Easterns then, and more
                    especially the Bgyptians, would profit from the example of the Japanese, they
                    must begin by enlarging their views of life, by realising that every utan has a
                    duty to his neighbours as well as to himself, and that the getting of bread and
                    butter is not the whole of sole object of lite. It is not the want of ability
                    that las been or is the curse of the Eastern peoples, but the want of the will
                    to apply and use the ability they have, as it ought to be used. Un less and
                    until they can do this, they will never besither beneficial or dangerous to the
                    peoples who can.</p>

                <p>Sr. PETERSBURG, December 18. Despatches from General Stoessel give par ticulars
                    of the furious assaults which took place at intervals from the 20th November to
                    the 6th December, and in which the Japanese lost 20,000 men.</p>
                <p>General Stoessel states that the enemy, on the 6th insti, captured Wysookaya

                <p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPANESE.</p>
                <p>Tokio, December 18. The "Sevastopol" has been successfully torpedoed ten times.
                    She is now aground and evidently completely disabled.</p>
                <p>General Stoessel opened negotiations with a view to protecting the hospitals from
                    the bombardment. He furnished to the Japanese a map of the bospital positions.
                    General Nogi replied accepting the map, but pointing out that, owing to the
                    invisibility of the garrison, and the deviation of the Japanese guns, it was
                    impossible to guarantee that the shells would reach the spot on which they were
                    directed. The bearer of General Stoessel's letter asked the Japanese not to
                    bombard the whole of the new town and the north-eastern part of the old town,
                    but the Japanese refused to limit the ares</p>

                <p>CH-Fu, December 18. A Russian despateb bearer says that the Russian losses on
                    293-metre bill were under 2,000.</p>
                <p>He gives a graphie account regarding the capture of 203-metre bill. The Japanese
                    as saulted the place three times. The whole side of the hill was covered with
                    corpses, and the trenches were rivulets of blood. The Japanese lighted huge wood
                    and coal fires, and the wind drove the smoke and flames into the faces of the
                    Russians, who were forced to retreat. The glare of the conflagration disclosed a
                    ghastly scene of horror.</p>
                <p>Admiral Wirenius has been slightly wounded by a shell while crossing the harbour
                    at Port Arthur.</p>

                <p>Constantinople, December 13 A special Persian mission will go to Cairo this
                    winter, in order to pay an official visit to H.H. the Khedive in the name of the
                    Shah of Persis. The mission will be bended by H. H. Prince Mirza Riza Khan,
                    Persian Ambassador at Constantinople, who is now at St. Petersburg on a mission
                    to the Tsar.</p>
                <p>It is said that the despatch of this mission to Cairo has some connexion with the
                    recent incident at the Persian Consulate General in the Egyptian capital It will

                    The men are to take with them their complete kit as well as a gala uniform,

                    contribute towards the Ottoman Fleet. Up to now only LE. 250 has been collected.
                    In Cairo, the Greek oolony recently subsor.bed LE. 5,500 immediately on the
                    opening of the list of subscriptions towards purchasing an addition to the
                    Hellenic Fleet.</p>
                <p>By the way, we learn that it has been decided by the Hellenes to buy a cruiser

                    in that portion of the Blue Nile where the Count now is, so there is every
                    prospect of a successful "bag." The Count is accompanied by Baron Horodjiosky

                    which ran amok at the beginning of last month, as mentioned by us at the time.
                    He was sent to the Pasteur Institute at Cairo for treatment, but the inoculation
                    made was attended with unsatisfactory results. The late Mr. Camilleri was a

                        was watching his plantation last night, he was shot by some person unknown.
                        The bullet struck the liver, and the man died six hours afterwards. He was
                        able to say that he did not see anyone approaching him, and would therefore
                        have been unable to recognise the murderer. His friend made the same
                        statement on giving notice to the police, which he did at onos. Next day,
                        the Mamour of the Naiba, socompanied by the moswen and the Laxor sanitary
                        doctor, examined the body and found that the bullet entered under the
                        shoulder, proving that the man bad his arms over his hend and was probably
                        carrying some load at the time he was shot. A quantity of maize was found
                        near a shadoof close by, which appeared to bave been taken from a
                        neighbouring property. The way in which this had been out showed that the
                        thief was acquainted with the place. The owners of the stolen property
                        denied all knowledge of the matter and the deceased's friend stated that if
                        they were concerned in the murder he would at once be able to identify them.
