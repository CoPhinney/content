                <head>THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY</head>
                <p>The re-election of Mr. Roosevelt to the Presidency of the United States will be
                        received with general satisfaction throughout the world, for his
                        individuality has probably made a deeper and more definite impression, not
                        merely on his fellow-countrymen, but on the world at large, than any
                        Presidential candidate before him. During Mr. Roosevelt's tenure of office
                        he has made his countrymen realise that for America the days of "isolation"
                        are passed, and the polict of perpetual "non-interference" outworn ; that
                        the acquisition of the Phillipines and the broadening sphere of American
                        interests in China and the Pacific make the old ideal of seclusion untenable
                        ; and that the United States is now a "World-Power" in fact as well as on
                        paper. Or perhaps it would be more corect to say that while all Americans
                        realise that these things are so, and that a change has come over America's
                        international position, Mr. Roosevelt went a step further in drawing from
                        the new state of affairs its legitimate and inevitable inferences. One of
                        these inferences is that American policy in the Far East must be more
                        vigorous and decisive than it has been in the past. Another is a recognition
                        of the axiom that diplomacy to be effective cannot rest solely on depsatch
                        writing, but must be supported by at least an implication of force. A third
                        deduction, likewise inescapable, is that American interests demand a
                        constantly-growing Navy, maintained in a state of the highest efficiency.
                        There is nothing in these propositions that is in any way novel or alarming.
                        They are accepted and acted on by every country that has foreign interests
                        and a foreign policy, and if they have startled a section of the people of
                        the United States it is simply because the inveterate provincialism of her
                        people has yet to admit that they cannot have the position and the
                        privileges of a World-Power without also incurring some, at least, of its
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of his opponents, the Democratic party, on the other hand, so
                        far as it is not reducible into a mere policy of scuttle, say they desire,
                        to preserve American interests and the "open door" in China, yet, when
                        anything practical is done to further either object, </p>
                    <p>they at once begin quoting Washington's farewell address and inveighing
                        against "militarism" and "aggressiveness". The common sense of America has,
                        at the result of the election shows, entirely approved the strong and
                        definite line which Mr. Roosevelt followed in Ear Eastern affairs. His
                        diplomacy, bith before and since the outbreak of the war, has been
                        singularly effective and pertinacious without being provocative, and the
                        Democrats in challenging it were at bottom challenging the need of America
                        to have any foreign policy or interests at all. And that too is
                        fundamentally their position on the Philippine question. Mr. Roosevelt
                        frankly embraces American Imperialism, both on its humanitarian and its
                        political side. He believes that America has a great and civilising work to
                        do in the Philipines, and he realises that the possession of the archipelago
                        must have in the future, as it already has had in the past, a vital
                        influence on American policy in the Far East. "The voice of the United
                        States," he said in his letter accepting the Republican nomination for the
                        Presidency, "would now count for nothing in the Far East if they abandoned
                        the Philippines." Mr. Roosevelt's policy is, therefore, to stay in the
                        Philippines, to educate the natives so far as possible in self-government,
                        and to develop in all ways the resources of the archipelago.This, too, we
                        are convinced, is the policy of nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every
                        thousand Americans. The Democrats persisted in advocating the abandonment of
                        the islands. Taking no account whatever of differences in race and political
                        and economic conditions, they hold that the solution of the problem is to
                        treat the Filipinos as the Cubans were treated-that is, to haul down the
                        American flag, leave the islanders to themselves under the shadow of
                        American Suzerainty, retain perhaps a few coaling and naval stations, but
                        otherwise to clear out of the archipelago completely. Moreover, they pledged
                        themselves to announce their intention of ultimately granting the Filipinos
                        independence directly Judge Parker was installed in the White House. It is
                        evident that the spirit in which the Democrats approached the question was
                        sentimental to the verge of hysteria and that they only half accepted the
                        consequences and resultant duties of the Spanish War. In this there can
                        hardly be any doubt that they utterly misrepresented the feelings and
                        determination of the vast bulk of their countrymen. </p>
                    <p>Nor were the Democrats much happier in attacking Mr. Roosevelt's policy at
                        specific points. They made, indeed, great play with his alleged extension or
                        perversion of the Monroe Doctrine. "If a (South American) nation," he said a
                        few months ago, "shows that it knows how to act with decency in industrial
                        and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, then it
                        need fear no interference from the United States." The Democrats at once
                        jumped to the conclusion that should a South American State fail in these
                        particulars, Mr. Roosevelt would be ready to advocate interference, and thus
                        land his country in limitless responsibilities. The language, as is usual
                        with Mr. Roosevelt, is certainly somewhat peremptory, and the gravity of the
                        implied threat is undeniable. But with Mr. Roosevelt it is always advisable
                        to pay less attention to what he says than to what he does. His action
                        throughout the Venezuelan mess was conspicuously moderate and perspicacious,
                        and made it clear that while he would resist any attemptat the partition or
                        absorption of a South American Republic by a European Power he would not
                        otherwise protect an offending Republic from proper punishment for its
                        misdeeds. In other words, he construes the Monroe Doctrine as entailing on
                        its beneficiaries the obligation, as he puts it, of "acting with decency."So
                        far from being an extension of the doctrine,this is rather a contraction of
                        it, and a translation of its indefiniteness into terms of reason and
                        practicality. Europe could wish for no better guarantee that the South
                        American States will falfil their obligations and observe the ordinary
                        comities of civilisation than the assurance that the United States will only
                        side with them in a just and reasonable cause. For the rest the success of
                        Mr. Roosevelt’s decisive action in Panama is its best defence while his
                        resoluteness in ordering an American squadron first to Beyrout on the rumour
                        that an American Vice-Consul had been murdered; secondly, to Tangier when
                        Mr. Perdicaris was captured by the Moorish brigands; and thirdly, to Smyrna
                        when Turkish dilatoriness had worn out American patience, will be best
                        appreciated by those who have studied Turkish and Moorish diplomacy most
                        closely. Each was a bold stroke; but the boldness, as the issue proved, was
                        that of knowledge and swift adaptation of means to ends. Mr. Roosevelt, when
                        called on to justify his foreign policy, need only point to its results. In
                        his home policy, too, he has been equally successful, for, though the
                        success of his Anti Trust policy may have alienated Wall Street, the average
                        citizen applauded it. Taken as a whole as a man, a party leader, and a
                        President, Mr. Roosevelt well deserves his victory, and the world at large
                        will congratulate the citizens of the United States on having reelected him
                        to the Presidency.</p>

                   <p><date when="1904-11-09">London, November 9.</date></p>    
                   <p>Lord Lansdowne, speaking at the Guildhall, concluded by saying he believed
                        that our convention with the friendly French Republic would establish the
                        most intimate and cordial relations between France and Great Britain, and
                        enable them to exercise a useful and pacific influence on other Powers. He
                        mentioned, as an instance, the assistance of France in effecting an amicable
                        settlement between Grent Britain and Russia.</p>
                    <p>In opening his speech, Lord Lansdowne said that the attack on British
                        citizens in the North Sea was an affront to the British flag, the
                        consequences of which, if it had been intentional, he would rather not
                        contemplate the recent evidence satistied him that the Russian Government
                        believed in good faith the facts, Which were contrary to what we supposed.
                        We received during the last day or two a distinct assurance that the
                        officers detained were those implicated in the incident, and that, if the
                        enquiry proves that others are culpable, they also will be adequately
                        punished. Referring to other irritating incidents of the war, his lordship
                        said it would be unfortunate if we now forfeited belligerent privileges
                        which we might desire to exercise if we were the belligerent. He referred to
                        the success of British diplomacy in obtaining a mitigation of the exercise
                        of Russia's belligerent rights, and pointed to the fact that not a single
                        British ship had been seized since July. He believed this terrible war would
                        stimulate the prevalent desire for some less clumsy and brutal method of
                        adjusting international differences. Arbitration has now become the fashion,
                        and only yesterday Mr. Choate asked if Great Britain were prepared to sign
                        an Anglo-American arbitration treaty.</p>

                Last Monday Casperoni wrote two letters, one to his family and the other 
                to the Italian Consul, in which he said that he was going to put an end to his life
                in Old Cairo. Accordingly, on Tuesday night he went to the European Cemetery and blew
                his brains out near the tomb of his wife, who had died six months ago, The unfortunate man
                was taken to the Kasr-el-Aini Hospital, where he expired shortly afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Without the fact being permitted to make too much noise in the outer world, a
                        really serious situation seems to be developing in the Yemen. At Beyrout, in
                        Syria, strong bodies of troops are being massed and pushed forward towards
                        Arabia with such rapidity that a great disaster to Ben Raschid, the Turkish
                        Viceroy, is believed to have taken place. Sen Sayd, the most powerfal Arab
                        sheikh in the region, who disposes of 20,000 well-armed men, is believed to
                        aim at founding an independent kingdom of Central Arabia, and such a victory

                    <p>MASSACRED BY ARABS</p>
                    <p>The India Office confirms the report of the massacre of the captain and
                        twenty-one of the crew of the British steamer <name>Baron Innerdale</name> on the Arabian
                        coast. In August last the vessel, which was on a voyage from Karachee to
                        Liverpool, with a cargo of wheat, went ashore on the Kuria Muria Island. The
                        captain and crew took to the boats, and were driven along by the monsoon to
                        Mosecra Island. On hearing of the wreck, <name>H.M.S. Merlin,</name> accompanied by the
                        Sultan of Muscat, on his own steamer, went in search of the missing crew.
                        Inquiry was made at various places along the coast, but no news could be
                        obtained of the men. Not satisfied with this visit, the Sultan made a second
                        trip, and at Mosecra Island obtained evidence that the captain and crew had
                        been massacred by natives. The Sultan took nine of the murderers prisoners,
                        and, according to a telegram from the naval commander in-chief of the Bast
                        Indies, is making efforts to secure the remainder. It is not believed that
                        many of the massacred men were British.</p>

                    <p>ONE MAN KILLED</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon, a horse attached to a carriage which was standing in Sis
                        ters-street without the driver on the box took fright at some passing object
                        and bolted up this busy thoroughfare at a frightful pace. The animal caused
                        a panic among the passers-by, who fed in all directions. One old man, a
                        workman, however, who was walking in the street, was unaware of the horse's
                        approach, and was knocked down by it, the wheels of the carriage. passing
                        over him. He died almost instantly. Another man was knocked over and
                        seriously injured. The animal continued on its mad career until it came into
                        violent collision with a carriage. This vehicle was overturned and smashed,
                        but its occupants fortunately escaped without any bodily. injuries. The
                        horse was captured before proceeding any further.</p>

                <p>FAUST</p>
                    <p>Gounod's Faust was repeated at the above theatre last evening, and although
                        no one. shone especially brightly, the performance was, on the whole, a good
                        one. The palm of the evening was won easily by Sig. M. Baldelli as Mephisto.
                        His fine voice is always worth going to hear, and his singing last night was
                        much appreciated. His rendering of the well-known serenade in the third act
                        was accorded hearty applause, and his performance throughout the opera was
                        excellent. Signa. Zoe Nesleda's interpretation of Marguerite was not
                        entirely a concincing one, although she occasionally sang with skill and
                        effect, sharing with Signore Pagani considerable applause. Signor Pagani,
                        however, did not appear to be in as good voice as usual, we have heard him
                        to much better advantage in characters other than Faust. Sig. Badini made an
                        acceptable valentine and Signa. Cecchi a very charming looking Siebel. The
                        chorus and orchestra were, as usual, excellent. We think, however, a little
                        less cornet in the badn on the stage would be an improvement. </p>

                        Standard, which is the centre of respect and grandeur. The General Officer
                        Commanding then approached his Highness and asked for his permission to
                        review the troops before him. The British forces then marched past his
                        Highness, who received the salute of both officers and men. After the second
                        Royal Salute and the Khedivial Salute, the General Officer Commanding asked
                        for his Highness's permission to dismiss the troops, which his Highness
                        granted, after expressing his gratification and eulogising the fine
                        discipline and bearing of the soldiers. With his Highness were preset the
                        President of the Council of Ministers and other Ministers.</p>

                        lying between the Nile and the Zambesi. The journey will occupy about
                        eighteen months, and the explorer will pass through that portion of the
                        Congo territory which is very little known. He left Cairo yesterday evening
                        on his way to Khartoum. At this place he will embark on a Sudanese

                <p>ASSOUAN SHOOTING CASE</p>
                <p>The case of Rex v. Sleeman came before Judge Sausmarez in the Supreme Consular
                        Court at Alexandria this morning, Mr. (unknown) represented the Crown and
                        Mr. Gettlish appeared for Mr. Sleeman.</p>
                    <p>The jury was composed of Messrs. Harry Barker, Percy Smith, Darton, Brown,
                        and Simpson.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sleeman, it will be rememberedm was the manager of the North Nile Valley
                        Co., carrying on operations in the desert about 80 miles from Assouan. The
                        accused was changed with maliciously wounding with a revolver.</p>
                    <p>The Counsel for the Crown opened the case. After dealing with the technical
                        features of the charge, he gave a brief summary of the case. In April last
                        accused engaged a number of Sudanese for his mining operations. After 60
                        days, the work beginning about April, a dispute arose about the food, the
                        flour falling short. Gomar Said, Gohar Hassan, Ahmed Said, and Reslan Said
                        were the chief (unknown)tents and they shortly after quitted the mining camp
                        and went to Assouan. Some time after the defendant went to Assouan and on
                        the 19th July was interviewed by these men in regard to some wages due.
                        Another interview took place on the following day, when the discussion
                        lasted so long that Mr. Sleeman lost his train. On the next day the matter
                        was referred to the Sub-Moudir and all the men, except Goma Said should be
                        paid. On the 21st June, as accused was about to go to the station, the men
                        presented themselves and asked for payment. They came, it was alleged, with
                        no hostile intent and not even armed with sticks. Mr. Sleeman, accompanied
                        by his assistant, Mr. Halliday had just left the Grand Hotel on a donkey and
                        the fourth shot went into the air. After this some confusion ensued. A
                        struggle occurred and two policemen came up. The defendant and the four
                        Sudanese were arrested.</p>
                    <p>Counsel then went on to state that it behoved the jurty to consider a letter,
                        written in the third week in July and addressed to the Sub-Moudir. In view
                        of this letter and and the other circumstances of the case; did the
                        defendant act with premeditation or under reasonable apprehension of danger,
                        present or imminent?</p>
                    <p>The first witness called was Mr. James Currie, of Khartoum, director of
                        Education to the Sudan Government. At the time of the occurrence he was at
                        the Grand Hotel, Assouan. He heard a revolver shot near the hotel. He went
                        to the windows, when he ehard another shot, and he went out to see what was
                        going on. He then heard another shot, and he went ourt to see what was going
                        on. He then heard another shot. When he got to the door a sort of confused
                        scrimmage was going on. He saw the accused and a native. They were on the
                        ground together, but the confusion was so great, it was hard to distinguish
                        properly. A few minutes after some police appeared. There was not a large
                        crowd. He could not say whether (unknown) was there or not. He heard no
                        special cries except an universal jabbering, nor did he hear any cries for
                        assistance, either in English or Arabic. A few of the natives had sticks of
                        the ordinary size they carry, and stout enough to knock a man down with, if
                        they tried. He could not say whether those who carried sticks belonged to
                        the men engaged in the fracas or merely spectators. He only heard three
                        shots. From the first shot to the arrival of the police about three minutes
                        elapsed.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gottlieb:-He would call these sticks nabouts. A blow
                        form one of these sticks, if properly delivered, would possibly kill a man.
                        When he left the hotel he was not in fear that the defendant was in danger,
                        as he did not know he was there. He told the Sub-Moudir to get him to the
                        Zaptieh and wire to the ministry of the interior, to prevent him being
                        subject to further violence. Everybody was flourishing either their sticks
                        or their hands. He saw the nabouts when he came out of the hotel. It was
                        impossible to give any idea of the numbers of the crown, when he first came
                        out of the hotel. The throng was thickening every moment.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Briscoe:- When he made his suggestion to the Moudir he did so with the
                        idea that it would be the best thing to do under any circucmstances. He gave
                        the advice hurriedly, as the had to run for his train. The people were then
                        very excited.</p>
                    <p>Gomar Said, workman, Assouan, was then called.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Briscoe:-</p>
                    <p>He remembered being engaged for the mines by defendant. This was not a year
                        ago. The terms of his contract were for four months at P.T. 5 per day. He
                        did not work for the whole time, only for 60 days because at the end of that
                        time the food was done. At the end of that time one month's salary was still
                        due. After the end of the 60 days he was dismissed and he went to Assouan.
                        Fourteen other workmen were dismissed at the same time, as the provisions
                        were over. He did not see the defendant for fifteen days after, when he saw
                        him in the hotel at Assouan. He went to see him but could not remember the
                        day. The hour was at 8 a.m. This was the day before he was shot. He went to
                        see the defendant to ask for payment of the money, but the latter did not
                        answer. At that time witness was with three others, Rislan Said, Ahmed Said,
                        and Gohar Hassain.</p>
                    <p>(To be continued.)</p>
