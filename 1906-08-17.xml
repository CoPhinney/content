                    <head>A MILITARY SCANDAL</head>
                    <p>The Report of the Royal Commission on War Stores in South Africa is not only
                        in itself a very painful document but it cannot fail to arouse serious
                        misgivings as to matters which did not fall within the purview of the
                        Commissioners. It is bad enough to be told that the total preventable loss
                        to the home taxpayer during the 22 months after the Peace lies somewhere
                        between three-quarters of a million sterling and one and a quarter million
                        sterling. But the real sting of the Report to our mind (says the "Globe")
                        consists of the general impeachment of the foresight and business capacity
                        of the implicated officials, civil and military. The Commissioners have
                        placed on record incidentally their conviction that no private firm could
                        avoid bankruptcy if it allowed its agents to deal with business matters in
                        the mode in which certain officers of high rank in the Army Service Corps
                        have dealt with the purchase and sale of supplies. The same reflection is
                        forced upon the reader of the Report, only with a much wider and. more
                        universal application. If an Empire like ours cannot get better yalue out of
                        its servants, and cannot exact a higher standard of ability and integrity,
                        the day of decline and fall cannot be very far distant. On the general
                        question of corruption, indeed, the Commissioners do not find that the,
                        sweeping innuendos of Sir William Butler and his col- leagues have any solid
                        foundation in fact.Certain officers and non-commissioned, officers have
                        gravely misconducted themselves, and their fate is left to the military
                        authority A censure, severe, but, in our judgment hardly severe enough, is
                        passed upon Colonel Morgan: it is all the more to be deplored when the
                        Commissioners admit that officer to be a man of exceptional capacity in the
                        Army Service Corps whose career had been one of rapid and deserved success.
                        It is very unpleasant, als, to find that the Army Service. Corps regulations
                        forbidding social inter course with contractors were habitually disregarded
                        by officials holding positions of great responsibility. The Army Service
                        Corps emerges from the inquiry with a heavy stain on what had been a
                        brilliant record, and its personnel will require a drastic purging</p>
                    <p>But, as we have said before, the main interest of the inquiry lies in its
                        revelations of the incapacity of the Military authorities and of the War
                        Office to deal with a situation which must have been foreseen months before
                        it actually took shape. All through the spring of 1902 it was patent to
                        those in authority that the Boer resistance was weakening, that the end
                        might come at any moment, and that a prodigious amount of Army stores would
                        have to be disposed of. Lord Kitchener, indeed, had made provision for
                        winding up the financial side of the war by appointing Major Armstrong as
                        Financial Adviser to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief; and the ink
                        was scarcely dry on the Vereeniging treaty when he created the sales
                        department for taking over all surplus stores, and entrusted its
                        organization to Colonel Morgan, who, up to that date, was fully deserving of
                        the confidence of his superiors. Unhappily, Lord Kitchener left Africa
                        almost immediately after the war was at an end, and from that date chaos
                        ensued. The South African military command was divided into three, but
                        through an omission, the responsibility of which is not travel, Major
                        Armstrong was given no place in the reconstruction. And thus a post which
                        Lord Kitchener considered of vital importance during the critical period of
                        demobilization and the disposal of supplies and stores was left in abeyance.
                        Worse than this, the detail- ed arrangement, administrative and financial,
                        necessary for carrying the division of the command into practical working
                        operation" seems to have altogether escaped the attention of the
                        Quartermaster General's department for nearly three months, while the
                        Finance Department of the War Office issued no in- structions at all. One
                        step, however, was taken towards the end of August. Orders came out from
                        England recalling Colonel Morgan, and appointing Colonel Hipwell as Director
                        of Supplies in his place. This substitution was not due to any distrust of
                        Colonel Morgan, but to a mere pedantic adhesion to the principles of
                        seniority, regardless of experience and capacity. The Commissioners acquit
                        Colonel Hipwell of direct misconduct, but they make their opinion of his
                        unfitness for the post perfectly apparent.</p>
                    <p>Among the consequences of Colonel Morgan's recall was the enormous loss
                        sustained by the working of the local contract system. It was originally
                        devised by him with the approval of Lord Kitchener, and entailed the
                        disposal on the spot of the surplus stores to local on- tractors, and their
                        re-purchase from time to time without drawing fresh supplies from home.
                        Under an exceptionally capable officer it might possibly have succeeded,
                        though the odds are strongly against it; and when once the fatal
                        entanglements with Meyer (Limited) had been entered into, its fate was
                        sealed. Colonel Morgan was largely, but not solely, responsible for this
                        arrangement, and his conduct in getting a highly-paid berth in that concern
                        for his brother was most censurable. Had he remained at the head of affairs,
                        his knowledge and ability might have checked some of the grosser abuses, but
                        Colonel Hipwell was a child in the hands of the Philistines. He had not
                        devised the system of local contracts, and had had no part in its
                        recommendation, But he and his subordinate, Captain Limond, not only
                        accepted it without examination or protest, but with a whole-hearted
                        devotion worthy of a better cause they strove to give the system the
                        appearance of a working concern, "they sacrificed public money, abandoned
                        legal rights and equitable claims, and by continual subsidy and concession,
                        succeeded in giving to the contractors a false semblance of activity." The
                        miserable story of the contractors and their victims, of the criminal
                        careless- ness of some officers, of the incredible reckless- ness of others,
                        was told in the daily reports of evidence taken before the Commission. The
                        real guilt lies with those who allow so vital a department of the Army to be
                        improperly, and insufficiently staffed, and with the War Office clerks in
                        the finance department ar home, who neglected the whole series of
                        transactions in South Africa, and resented all efforts at inquiry. One of
                        these, a worthy successor of Tite Barnacle in "Little Dorrit," suggested
                        that if the Controller and Auditor-General persisted in his inquiries he
                        should be "told to mind his own business." The Coar missioners have also to
                        complain of the carelessness and indifference of the military authorities in
                        South Africa, and it is apparent that the inquiries prosecuted under their
                        directions in the sub-Continent met with ill-disguised obstruction. The
                        Commissioners have discharged a most difficult and invidious task in at
                        manner commensurate with their high reputation</p>

                        merchandise imported into the country during that month amounted to LE

                        January to July 31 the imports Amounted in value to LR 12,399,649, a
                        compared to LE. 10,937,992 in the corresponding period of last year, showing
                        a total incrosss of L.B. 1,369,427, which may be con- sidered highly
                        satisfactory. Great Britain as anal beads the list of importing countries,

                        41,872, or a little over 10% bath Germany and Belgiam have more than doubled
                        their imports, the former progressing from L.E. 66,968 to LE 114.850 and the
                        latter from LE 53,744 to IB. Preneb imports also showed much larger
                        increases than British imports, the figures rising from LE 134,780 to 1K
                        204,645. These figures are eloquent of the increasing competition which
                        British traders have to meet on the Egyptian market. The imports from the
                        United Kingdom during the month amounted to LE 545,151, as against L.B.
                        603,979 in July, 1905. If, however, we add to the above figures the imports
                        from British possessions in the Medi- terranean (LB 14,188) and in the Far
                        East (LE.59,984) we got a total of "British" imports of LB. 619,693. Torning
                        to exports, we find that the value of these during July amounted to LE
                        875,721, As compared to LE 1,174,409, a drop of LE $98,688, which is mostly
                        accounted for by the decreased export of cotton, there being a fall of LE
                        233,567 under this head. The figures for the seven months from January 1 to
                        Jaly 81, however, show a substantial increase of LK 1,246,020 ie the
                        exports, the total being LE 12,030,381. The United Kingdom, which was the
                        largest bayer, decreased her purchases in Jaly from LAR. 535,603 in 1905 to
                        L.B.492,073 in 1906. Germany, who, as we have said, more than doubled her
                        exports to this country, on the other hand, imported less than half the
                        goods she did in the previous July from hoBart. There were also decreased

                        like Lord Cromer." In these words an Egyptian gentleman, who holds a
                        prominent official position in his native country, and who is at present in
                        London, expressed himself to a "Daily News" representative "He is a father
                        to us, and we would all fight to the death for him. To the small farmer
                        especially (and there are a large number of small boulders in Egypt), Lord
                        Cromer is a great friend. To give you an example, only a very little while
                        ago he introduced a revised system of land taxation, by which the owner of
                        poor land is relieved of some part of the burden of taxation. Formerly, the
                        Pashas and the big owners of land paid practically no land tax, and then
                        property was called osbori, or free.They, of course, possessed the most
                        fertile land. "Now they are made to pay 164 piastres (34%) acre Tand tax,
                        while the owner of poorer land pays less in proportion to the value of his
                        land for agriculture, down to a minimum of 20% an acre. That is jestics. It
                        is marvelous to the small Egyptian farmer to feel that if he has a grievance
                        he can go to Lord Cromer and speak face to face with him, and get attention
                        and justice. Lord Cromer is always traveling among us. You do not bear it
                        over here. He is too quiet a man for that. But we know, and we love him for
                        it." Referring to the cultivation of rope in Egypt, the visitor explained
                        that barley and fodder (or berseem sa bhi called it)-are largely cultivated;
                        whos, Indian core, and cotton are the staple europe in Upper Egypt. The
                        cotton is sold for about £10 to £15 an sor. The price of wheat varies
                        greatly, as it does here. But our whost is fuller in the ear than yours, and
                        oor straw is thinner. We are now, of course, almost independent of the
                        weather for our crops since the Assosan dam has been working, and our system
                        of irrigation is wonderful. I have only been a little time in Bagland, a few
                        weeks, but I have soon enough to show me that you ought to copy it "You have
                        taught us a great deal, but you have not learnt that lesson yourselves. We

                        otherwise. You can rely a little on raios, and therefore you leave it to

                        then-then you will start irrigation all over the country. "We have an
                        Agricultural Society in Egypt now, which is studying all questions of
                        agricul ture that affect the country, and it is doing very good work. Also,
                        on Lord Cromer's initiative, a complete survey has been made of the land and
                        many abuses on the taxation farms they were paying too moob tax; they were
                        charged for acres that they did not posers and had never possessed That is

                        the ground with Sir K Grey's admission that fanaticism had nothing to do
                        with the villagers' attack on the offer, whom they mistakenly regarded (1)
                        as poachers, and (3) as responsible for the wounding of one of their women.
                        To advise a suspension of criticism until the receipt of the official report
                        was in theory proper, but that argument should have postponed the defense as
                        well as the attack. But on Baterday, despite the publication of the report,
                        Sir E Grey thought to complain that such cri- tisiems Mr. Robertson's
                        moderate and reasoned speech would make the conduct of the Empire
                        impossible. Mr. Balfour himself hardly went farther in his denial of the
                        prerogatives of Parliament, while to promise Mr. Findlay promotion in such a
                        context war, in effect, to encostage every official in the Empire to ignore,
                        and even to sit in judgment on, the House of Commons. If Egyptians were to
                        draw the inference that they have no right of appeal against the competent,
                        bet not infallible, baressoracy which ralee them, and that any attempt to
                        present their grievances will be denounced by Ministers as an offense
                        against the Bapire, the government of Egypt might be simplified, indeed, but
                        we doubt if it would be rendered easier. Jobs Strange Winter, writing in the
                        "De Telegraph" on British squeamishner, mys Take the instance of the murder
                        of an officer in Egypt a few weeks ago. Several officers were invited to a
                        pigeon about, and one paid the penalty of his life, and several others were
                        seriously maltreated. I do not myself look upon pigeon shooting as a
                        particularly elevating or manly kind of sport; at the same time,
                        pignon-shooting is allowed, and death is a very heavy price to pay for
                        indulging in it. But I really fail to see why we in Bogland should ory Shams
                        upon the authorities for the very just punishment which was meted out to the
                        perpetrators of this foal warder. We are altogether booming too squeamish
                        Public opinion, as conjured up by that peculiar power which we call the
                        liberty of the Press, is becoming in these ister days just a veritable bagia
                        with which, if we are not very careful, we shall have great difficulty in
                        dealing. </p>

                    <p>ONOMANY AND ROYPT On the 14th inst. there appeared in "Al Minbar" a quense to
                        the interview with a certain German, to which we referred the 8 other day.
                        According to the article, of which we write, this German remarked that
                        England has an object in accusing the Egyptians of fanaticism. "It is uot,"
                        he remarked, "for the sake of appointing a few more British officials, but
                        because the English are alarmed to see so many companies Bloated every day

                        foreign ospital in Egypt will make it international, so they try to frighten
                        the European so as to reserve the country to himself He added that the
                        policy of Great Britain in her colonies was to monopolie everything and
                        remarked to his interviewer, "Let me remind you how they invent cholera,

                        Writing under date of the 15'h inst, "Al Abram" sys-We have already
                        mentioned that in the reports relative to the Dennis Wai affair drawn up by
                        the Greek Consoles for their Government it was stated that the severity of
                        the sentences had had a beneficial effect on all classes of the population.
                        Since then, we have learnt from certain sources that in the reports sent by
                        the Italian Agey the Conals deny the existence of fanaticism, properly so
                        called, and are of the opinion that the sentences were severe and bard.
                        According to the more influential Italian papers, such as "La Tribass,"
                        which is semi- official, the Italians are among those who disapprove of the
                        severity of the sentences and who have such belief in the rumor that
                        fanaticism reigns in the country. </p>
