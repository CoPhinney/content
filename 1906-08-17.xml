                    <head>A MILITARY SCANDAL</head>
                    <p>The Report of the Royal Commission on War Stores in South Africa is not only
                        in itself a very painful document but it cannot fail to arouse serious
                        misgivings as to matters which did not fall within the purview of the
                        Commissioners. It is bad enough to be told that the total preventable loss
                        to the home taxpayer during the 22 months after the Peace lies somewhere
                        between three-quarters of a million sterling and one and a quarter million
                        sterling. But the real sting of the Report to our mind (says the "Globe")
                        consists of the general impeachment of the foresight and business capacity
                        of the implicated officials, civil and military. The Commissioners have
                        placed on record incidentally their conviction that no private firm could
                        avoid bankruptcy if it allowed its agents to deal with business matters in
                        the mode in which certain officers of high rank in the Army Service Corps
                        have dealt with the purchase and sale of supplies. The same reflection is
                        forced upon the reader of the Report, only with a much wider and. more
                        universal application. If an Empire like ours cannot get better yalue out of
                        its servants, and cannot exact a higher standard of ability and integrity,
                        the day of decline and fall cannot be very far distant. On the general
                        question of corruption, indeed, the Commissioners do not find that the,
                        sweeping innuendos of Sir William Butler and his col- leagues have any solid
                        foundation in fact.Certain officers and non-commissioned, officers have
                        gravely misconducted themselves, and their fate is left to the military
                        authority A censure, severe, but, in our judgment hardly severe enough, is
                        passed upon Colonel Morgan: it is all the more to be deplored when the
                        Commissioners admit that officer to be a man of exceptional capacity in the
                        Army Service Corps whose career had been one of rapid and deserved success.
                        It is very unpleasant, als, to find that the Army Service. Corps regulations
                        forbidding social inter course with contractors were habitually disregarded
                        by officials holding positions of great responsibility. The Army Service
                        Corps emerges from the inquiry with a heavy stain on what had been a
                        brilliant record, and its personnel will require a drastic purging</p>
                    <p>But, as we have said before, the main interest of the inquiry lies in its
                        revelations of the incapacity of the Military authorities and of the War
                        Office to deal with a situation which must have been foreseen months before
                        it actually took shape. All through the spring of 1902 it was patent to
                        those in authority that the Boer resistance was weakening, that the end
                        might come at any moment, and that a prodigious amount of Army stores would
                        have to be disposed of. Lord Kitchener, indeed, had made provision for
                        winding up the financial side of the war by appointing Major Armstrong as
                        Financial Adviser to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief; and the ink
                        was scarcely dry on the Vereeniging treaty when he created the sales
                        department for taking over all surplus stores, and entrusted its
                        organization to Colonel Morgan, who, up to that date, was fully deserving of
                        the confidence of his superiors. Unhappily, Lord Kitchener left Africa
                        almost immediately after the war was at an end, and from that date chaos
                        ensued. The South African military command was divided into three, but
                        through an omission, the responsibility of which is not travel, Major
                        Armstrong was given no place in the reconstruction. And thus a post which
                        Lord Kitchener considered of vital importance during the critical period of
                        demobilization and the disposal of supplies and stores was left in abeyance.
                        Worse than this, the detail- ed arrangement, administrative and financial,
                        necessary for carrying the division of the command into practical working
                        operation" seems to have altogether escaped the attention of the
                        Quartermaster General's department for nearly three months, while the
                        Finance Department of the War Office issued no in- structions at all. One
                        step, however, was taken towards the end of August. Orders came out from
                        England recalling Colonel Morgan, and appointing Colonel Hipwell as Director
                        of Supplies in his place. This substitution was not due to any distrust of
                        Colonel Morgan, but to a mere pedantic adhesion to the principles of
                        seniority, regardless of experience and capacity. The Commissioners acquit
                        Colonel Hipwell of direct misconduct, but they make their opinion of his
                        unfitness for the post perfectly apparent.</p>
                    <p>Among the consequences of Colonel Morgan's recall was the enormous loss
                        sustained by the working of the local contract system. It was originally
                        devised by him with the approval of Lord Kitchener, and entailed the
                        disposal on the spot of the surplus stores to local on- tractors, and their
                        re-purchase from time to time without drawing fresh supplies from home.
                        Under an exceptionally capable officer it might possibly have succeeded,
                        though the odds are strongly against it; and when once the fatal
                        entanglements with Meyer (Limited) had been entered into, its fate was
                        sealed. Colonel Morgan was largely, but not solely, responsible for this
                        arrangement, and his conduct in getting a highly-paid berth in that concern
                        for his brother was most censurable. Had he remained at the head of affairs,
                        his knowledge and ability might have checked some of the grosser abuses, but
                        Colonel Hipwell was a child in the hands of the Philistines. He had not
                        devised the system of local contracts, and had had no part in its
                        recommendation, But he and his subordinate, Captain Limond, not only
                        accepted it without examination or protest, but with a whole-hearted
                        devotion worthy of a better cause they strove to give the system the
                        appearance of a working concern, "they sacrificed public money, abandoned
                        legal rights and equitable claims, and by continual subsidy and concession,
                        succeeded in giving to the contractors a false semblance of activity." The
                        miserable story of the contractors and their victims, of the criminal
                        careless- ness of some officers, of the incredible reckless- ness of others,
                        was told in the daily reports of evidence taken before the Commission. The
                        real guilt lies with those who allow so vital a department of the Army to be
                        improperly, and insufficiently staffed, and with the War Office clerks in
                        the finance department ar home, who neglected the whole series of
                        transactions in South Africa, and resented all efforts at inquiry. One of
                        these, a worthy successor of Tite Barnacle in "Little Dorrit," suggested
                        that if the Controller and Auditor-General persisted in his inquiries he
                        should be "told to mind his own business." The Coar missioners have also to
                        complain of the carelessness and indifference of the military authorities in
                        South Africa, and it is apparent that the inquiries prosecuted under their
                        directions in the sub-Continent met with ill-disguised obstruction. The
                        Commissioners have discharged a most difficult and invidious task in at
                        manner commensurate with their high reputation</p>
