                    <head>"PEACE WITH HONOUR."</head>
                    <p>Within the last day or so we have been on the very brink or war with Russia.
                        Had such a dastardly outrage upon our fishing fleet been perpetrated in the
                        good old days, admirals of the Nelson type would have sent the remnant of
                        the Russian navy to the bottom long before it had reached the coast of
                        Spain. Now-a-days, however, with the facilities for rapid communication
                        furnished by telegraphs and telephones, such terrible crises can be happliy
                        averted without bloodshed. Protests are launched, explanations interchanged,
                        sovereigns throw their personal influence into the scale, and diplomacy is
                        called into play, with the combined result of pouring oil on troubled waters
                        and easing a tension which in earlier times must inevitably have led to
                        hostilities. We should be sorry to think that the old spirit, which would
                        not brook an insult to England on the part of a foreigner, has become
                        softened by a higher state of culture, and that we would to-day clamly
                        submit to see the honour of our nation outraged one whit more than our
                        forefathers would have done. This feeling still lives, and our telegrams
                        have shown that the entire nation is at one in demanding reparation for what
                        was not only a blunder but a dsatradly crime. The general consensus of
                        opinion, as evinced by the great London daily newspapers, show that the
                        solution of this difficulty has been received with satisfaction. It is to be
                        hoped, therefore, that the wrong will be fully recognised by the arbitrators
                        and that the cuase of international comity will be served by the
                        righteousness of their award.</p>

                    <head>AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT WANTED.</head>
                    <p>A short time ago a rumor was started to the effect that the Egyptian
                        Government was about to form and Agricultural Department, but the report was
                        found to have been merely based on the fact that an increased grant was to
                        be made to the Khedivial Agricultural Society. It is much to be regretted
                        that the Government should have failed to have boldly faced the pressing
                        necessities of the situaution, in view of the very large amount of funds now
                        placed at its disposal. We could have wished that agriculture ahould have
                        received a larger share of administrative attention than heretofore, as for
                        years past we have persistently advocated in these columns that expediency
                        of giving effect to its claims. Afterall, husbandry in Egypt is an industry
                        which in magnitude and importance immeasurably transcends all other. The
                        expenditure, therefore, connected with the establishment of a department
                        exclusively devoted to the fostering and development of its interests would
                        be money profitably employed. "Agriculture" in its purely technical sense is
                        restricted</p>

                    <p>to the cultivator of the fields, whereas in its loose popular sense it covers
                        every kind of farming and includes, therefore, land development on its
                        pastoral side, e.g., sheep, dairy and ostrich farming, poultry rearing, and
                        horse breeding, as well as the raising of special crops. We trust there in
                        no disrespect in suggesting that the heads of the Public works Department,
                        though they be eminent authorities on irrigation, dam construction, and the
                        soil of the Nile Valley, have not had occasion in a professional capacity to
                        grow so much as a cabbage, and are therefore lacking that experience which
                        alone can form a true foundation for the special knowledge required by an
                        agriculturist. We must confess to our inability to fathom the reasons for
                        such speculative daring being manifested by the Government in embarking on
                        gigantic schemes for irrigation whilst the one and only purpose for which
                        such schemes are undertaken is utterly neglected. Even in England, where,
                        unfortunately, in our days, agriculture holds quite a secondary place, there
                        is a full-pledged Borad uncontrolled by and Department save the Treasury,
                        and capable of taking independent action. Why the should Egypt wait.</p>

                    <head>"HONOUR TO WHOM," ETC.</head>
                    <p>Considerable indignation is expressed by the public at the unwarrantable
                        attack on the Alexandria Fire Brigade which appeared in Saturday's La
                        Reforme in connection with Friday's fire at that newspaper's printing
                        establishment. We can only surmise that our usually sober contemporary had
                        lost its head in the excitement engendered by the regrettable conflagration.
                        The Reforme not only makes an utterly gratuitous and uncalled-for attack on
                        the Brigade, but indulges in distasteful personalities concerning its chief,
                        Superintendent Lynn, which should never have appeared in its columns. We
                        think that few, if any, of the spectators of the work done by the Fire
                        Brigade in extinguishing the conflagration will begrudge giving it the
                        credit which it is due. To have completely mastered the outbreak, when it
                        had already assumed considerable proportions, within the space of
                        half-an-hour, redounds to the credit of the Brigade and its chief. Our
                        contemporary makes the astounding assertion that the Brigade arrived only 43
                        minutes after having received notice of the fire. This statement we can only
                        characterise as baseless. We were ourselves witnesses of the arrival of the
                        engines and the firemen, and cannot bear out our contemporary's assertion,
                        which moreover is disproved entirely by the official recoreds kept by the
                        Fire Brigade and the Municipality. It is to be regretted that La Reforme
                        should have gone out of its way to cast a slur on the effciency of our Fire
                        Brigade, which is generally recognised as being of a hogh order.</p>

                        is the moving spirit, for cotton growing in the Sudan. This firm have over
                        half a century's experience as hydraulic engineers, and have turned out
                        centrifugal pumpimg machinery capable of discharging 363,636 cubic metres of
                        363 rivers as large as the Thames, or 72 rivers as large as the Nile.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. L. Webb, of the Irrigation Department, when in Holland in 1897, on
                        behalf of the Egyptian Government, gave and excellent report as to the
                        working of Gwynne's machinery in that country. In his work on Egyptian
                        Irrigation Sir William Willcocks remark:– "Indeed if it were not that the
                        quality of English engines is so high and the Gwynne's pumps themselves
                        nearly indestructible, pumping machinery would have succumbed to the Persian
                        wheels." (See page 246 "Egyptian Irrigation, 1889"). Some of these machines
                        have been at work for over fifty years.</p>

                    <p>THE COMING ENQUIRY.</p>
                    <p>TSAR AND THE CRISIS.</p>
                    <p>London, October 29.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour stated that the Russian naval authorities would ascertain which
                        officers were responsible, and the same will not proceed to the Far East. An
                        International Court of Enquiry, as provided for by the Hague Convention, and
                        not a court of arbitration, will enquire into the facts. There will also be
                        a special Board of Trade enquiry at Hull at which it is hoped Russia will be
                        represented.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour ridiculed Admiral Rodjestvensky's tale as a romance, which was
                        really an attack on our national honour. It was only bare justice to say
                        that the Tsar and the Russian Government had never underrated the crisis,
                        nor failed to do what they could to diminish it. They had always shown an
                        enlightened desire that truth and justice should prevail.</p>

                    <p>The Standard is of the opinion that no guarantee has been given that the

                    <p>FIGHT AMONG BISHAREEN.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Assouan, Saturday.– A very serious fight occurred here a few days ago amongst
                        the Bishareen Arabs at their camp outside the town, in the course of which
                        some 20 men were badly injured.</p>
                    <p>There appears to have been a quarrel between two of the natives, which, from
                        a personal matter, developed into a general scrimmage, bith parties
                        gathering together their supporters, with the result that knives and stickes
                        were freely used. </p>
                    <p>Had it not been for the prompt appearance of what we- for the want of a
                        better (or worse) term- call the police force, composed of some hundreds of
                        Bishareen, would have been engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter, but before
                        much blood had been shed the police had put a stop to further strife.</p>
                    <p>About 20 men are now cooling their heads in prison, and a further 17 with
                        broken pates and knife wounds are peacefully reposing in hospital.</p>

                    <p>The annual Chrysanthemum Show of the Kedivial Horticultural Society was held
                        at Ghezireh on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, the Earl and Countess of
                        Cromer, Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, and many of the leading members of the
                        Kedivial Societies of Agriculture and Horticulture were present. The weather
                        was fine and warm, rather too warm for many of the exhibits, which had begun
                        to droop and wither by Sunday afternoon. The exhibtion was on the whole a
                        success, though this year has been anything but a good one for
                        chrysanthemums, and though H. H. Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel, who has been in
                        former years one of the mostsucessful exhibitors on a large scale, was
                        unable to compete owing to the sudden death about a fortnight ago of his
                        chief gardener, whose professional skill was well known.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Foaden and Ahmed Bey Khouloussi were by far the most successful
                        exhibitors, winning no less than 13 first rpizes between them, besides
                        numerous seconds. The following were the awards:– </p>
                    <p>Class 1. Group of at least 25 pots of Chrysanthemums.– 1st, Ahmed Bey
                        Khouloussi; 2nd, Miss Florence Curtis.</p>

                    <p>The Alexandria Horticultural Society's seveth annual Chrysanthemum Show, held
                        at San Stefano on Saturday and yesterday, is the largest exhibition of the
                        kind that has ever been held here. It was so much larger than last year's
                        that there was no room for the cut flowers in the large ball-room of the
                        casino, and they and some of the pot plants had to be accommodated in the
                        reading-room. Great credit is due to Lady Blomfield, Mr. Rolo, and Mme C.
                        Debban, who, although living in the heart of Alexandria has never seen two
                        such beautiful boxes of chrysanthemums as thise sent by Mr. Rolo, and
                        amongst his collection was the best chrysanthemum in the show. The feature
                        of the large groups were the masses of white bloom. All the groups showed
                        much better taste than in the earlier exhibitions. The flowers were arranged
                        by masses of colours, as they are in Europe, and there was not that mixture
                        of colour which was far from artistic in the earlier shows. The Municipality
                        showed some very fine blooms, but theywere not for competition. The show was
                        well attended on both days. The following is the prize-list:– </p>

                    <p>There was an informal dicussion on the subject of the railway time-table, and
                        it was agreed that the Delta Railway Company should be approached with a
                        view to having a better time-table when it takes over the line.</p>
                    <p>We hear that the inhabitants of Helouan are si indignant at the little
                        practical use which the Local Commission is the the town, that it is
                        proposed to organise an indignation meeting, at whihe the many grievances
                        which the inhabitants suffer from, owing to the badness of the roads and the
                        impracticable railway time-table, which is most inconvenient for travellers
                        between Cairo and Helouan, will be aired.</p>

                    <p>A SPLENDID INNOVATION.</p>
                    <p>An excellent scheme for promoting thrift among the children of this country
                        has been elaborated by the Postmaster-General and will come into force on
                        January 1. On and after that date any children, whose parents are desirous
                        of encouraging thrifty habits in their offspring, will be furnished, on
                        application at the post-offices throughout Egypt, with printed cards on
                        which spaces will be allotted for ten five-millieme stamps. As soon as the
                        child has filled up such a card with stamps to the value of P.T. 5, he will
                        be able to present it to be deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank. </p>
                    <p>In order to extend the scope of of this beneficent measure all schoolmasters
                        will be authorised to give such cards to any of the pupils under their
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>The scheme is very praiseworthy and it will be interesting to observe how far

                    <p>200 yds. = 84 + 500 yds. = 35 + 600 yds. 32 = total 101, although unfortunate
