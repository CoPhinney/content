                        Government, which will probably do its utmost to prevent a measure which is
                        so far-reaching in its effect and which covers so much terrain brulant from
                        being the subject of a heated party debate in the French Cham- bers. For, as
                        was inevitable, while the principle of the agreement as a whole is accepted
                        on both sides of the Channel with enthusiasm, there is nevertheless in both
                        countries much opposition to its details founded on local considerations and
                        interests. Some authorities hold that, since every treaty is liable
                        ultimately to affect the finances of the State, the above exception
                        practically reduces the President's power of treaty-making to a mere form
                        and subjects the validity of all treaties to the ratification of the
                        Chambers. This, however, is not the view the view of the French Government
                        nor of the French Chambers themselves. It seems to be an established
                        principle that treaties of alliance are not included amongst those.
                        requiring the sanction of the Chambers. For instance, the treaty between
                        Russia and France which is the basis of the alliance between the two
                        countries has never been communicated to or ratified by the French Chambers,
                        but nobody thinks of questioning its validity on that account. The same is
                        the case with the Treaty of Berlin 1878, to which France was one of the
                        signatories. </p>

                <p> CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. During the debate on the religious policy of the
                    Government, M. Combes declared that, in view of the Vatican's open disregard for
                    the Concordat, the separa- tion of Church and State had become inevit- able. The
                    Chamber passed a vote of confidence in the Government by 325 to 237 votes. (R.)

                <p> By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late In- speetor-General of Irrigation in Lower
                    Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt (Coutinued.)</p>
                <p> Sir W. Willeocks' basis of caleulstion of the supply required is that a stored
                    quantity of one millised of cuble metres of water is suffi- clent fur the
                    conversion of 300,000 acres to pereanial irrigation; and also that, after tak
                    ing into account the milliard already provided by the Assonsn Reserroir, there
                    still remain 1j million aetes to be converted. Three mil liand eubie metres more
                    are, therefore, accord- ing bo has figures, required. One milliard is to be
                    poovided by mising the Assouan Dam 6 m pooposal already diseuseed as the first
                    item of Sir W. Gantin's programime. The remaining two milliards Sir W. Willeocks
                    proposes to roovide by storage in the Wadi Rayan, deprression in the Libyan
                    Desert to the south of the Fayoum, from which it is separated by a lmestone
                    ridge. The depression has, at a leve of about 29 m. abore the ses, a surfsce of
                    700 equare kilometres, about a quarter of the size of the ancient Lako Moeris.
                    The lowent point of the Wadi is 81 m. below sea-level. 1f Siled with water from
                    the Nile to make i serve as, a reservoir, it will be the top layer only of a few
                    metres' depth that will be utilised to supplement the summer Nile. The proposal
                    t make the Wadi Rayan a reservoir waa Mr. Cop W hitehogse's original
                    conoeptiom;but, originally conceived as an isolated project, ita weak point was
                    that by itself it wonld give a plentiful dis chatge in Apeil and May, less in
                    June, and very little in July, whereas what is wanted i the roverse. Sir W.
                    Willeoeks has now pointed ous that "whem the Asequan Reservoir i capable.of
                    supplying two milliands of eubie metres of frater it will be possible to utilise
                    the Moeris Lake to its atmost capacity. The As souan Reservoir, being high above
                    the level o the Nile, can give its stipply at the beginning or end of the
                    summer: it can give it slowly, or with a rueh, while the projeeted Lak Moeris,
                    being directly in communiention with the Nile, and only slightly above low Nile
                    level, its discharge would depend entirely on th ditferenee of level between it
                    and the Nile, and coseyuently as the entier advanced it would gridually fall,
                    and would not be able to giv at the end of the suminer a quarter of the di
                    charge it could give at the beginning. But us imagine that the reservoir and the
                    lake are both completed, and full of water, and that it is the first of April.
                    Lake Moeris - ie, th Rayan Beservoir-will be opened into the Nile and give all
                    the water peeded in that month while the Assouan Reeervoir will be maintaine at
                    its full level. In May, Lake Moeris will gi yearly the whole sapply and the
                    roservoir wil give a little. In June the lake will giye littl and the reservoir
                    much; while im July the lake will givo practically nothing and the reservoir the
                    whole supply. Working together in thi hanonious manher, the reservoir and the
                    lake which are the true complements of each othe will easily provide the whole
                    of the wate heeded for Egypt." Sir W. Garstin concodes that the schem thus
                    presented is a most attrnetive one. T foejeet of reviving the ancient Lake

                <p> A. 8. C. 8KYE MEETING. </p>
                <p> Saturday's race meeting was dull and uninteresting, the only notable feature of
                    the afternoon being the entirely unexpected win of Valentino in the race for the
                    San Stefano Plate, when he brought off a 45 to 1 chance. In this race, the
                    riding of Michaelides Jun. was considered unsatisfactory, and he was therefore
                    suspended by the stewards until the end of the year. There was a good deal of
                    betting and the odds in most cases were sufficiently attractive. P.T. 1,300 for
                    a dollar, which was netted by each of the four backers of Valentino, is probably
                    a record for the A.S.C. course. The ground, owing to the rain, was not conducive
                    to fast riding, as the horses skidded a great deal. Owing to the uncertainty
                    which prevailed as regards the elements, a large number of race-goers absented
                    themselves from the meeting, with the consequence that the attendance was
                    exceedingly poor, which added to the dulness of the after- noon, relieved only
                    by the excellent playing of the Royal Berkshire Band under the leader- ship of
                    Bandmaster Dore. The following were the resulta of the various races :-- MAIDEN
                    HURDLE RACE of P.T. 1,250 of which P.T. 250 to go to 2nd horse. For Maiden

                    came to the front and won a good race from the latter by a neck. This was a very
                    fast race considering the condition of the ground. Time-1.10. Betting .-
