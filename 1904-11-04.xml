                    <p>tion. Neither in the United Kingdom nor elsewhere was there ever the faintest
                        doubt that when the Chamber re-assembled it would take the matter in hand
                        with all possible dis- patch. That expectation is now fulfilled, and too
                        great credit could not be given to M. Cambon and M. Delcassé for the
                        patience and perseverance with which they helped Lord Lansdowne to smooth
                        away outstand- ing difficulties. But they could have done little or nothing
                        had not French feeling at large expressed itself unmistakably in favour of
                        strengthening and extending the entente between the neighbouring nations.
                        The French Colonial party having bestowed its blessing on. the concordat
                        diplomacy had an easy labour in giving the finishing touches to the New-
                        foundland Agreement. Here, again, it is only fair to admit that M. Deloncle
                        has full right to claim the renunciation by France of an irritat- ing clause
                        of the Treaty of Utrecht as an "important concession." It is of that
                        character, unquestionably, and although an equivalent has been given by
                        Great Britain elsewhere, the surrender by France of such very ancient rights
                        and privileges denotes genuine goodwill towards England. </p>

                    <p>Our Tantah Correspondent writes:-I had occasion a few days ago to complain
                        about the delay in transmission of telegrams between here and Alexandria.
                        Nothing seems to have been done as yet to remedy this inconvenience. During
                        the last few days messages have taken about two hours in transmission from
                        Alexandria, and many are the persons who have received telegrams advising
                        them of friends passing through Tantah after the train with their friends
                        had left! This is a serious state of things which should not be allowed to
                        continue. It is to be hoped that we shall soon have the telephone line
                        working, and then the Telegraph Department will see their receipts diminish
                        appreciably in consequence of their lax methods. </p>

                        performance given of L'Enfant du Miracle proved very successful, Mile
                        Armande Leturc was particularly conspicuous in the part of Elise, and Mile
                        Olga Bonin in that of Marguerite. Messrs. Silvestre, de Préfonds, Marmier
                        and La Claverie were also good. </p>
                    <p>There will be no performance at the Alham bes to-night. Tomorrow evening, the
                        "Archi mede Misuri" is announced to give an entertainment. On Sunday
                        afternoon, there will be a musical matinée and balloon ascents, one of the
                        balloons measuring 12 metres in height and 35 in circumference. In the
                        evening there will be a variety entertainment. </p>

                        <p> Sir, The letter which appeared in your issue of the 2nd inst. upon the
                            above subject invites favourable consideration at the hands of the
                            authorities. Sometimes, unfortunately, the physicians of the body
                            politic, through want of accurate diagnosis, prescribe the wrong remedy,
                            or, dropping metaphor, criticism, honest and well-meaning though it be,
                            fails of its effect through the writer's imperfect acquaintance with his
                            subject. Nosuch charge can be laid at the door of a "Child of the Nile
                            Valley," who is a precocious child indeed-a veritable infant prodigy,
                            conversant especially with the "wheels within wheels" of the
                            administrative machine, and especially where they are clogged and
                            inefficient. Such letters as his and you have published of late not a
                            few clearly indicate to the watchers in the "crow's nest" that a body of
                            enlightened and well- informed opinion is growing up in Egypt which will
                            courageously claim a bearing irrespective of the consequences. This is a
                            most healthy sign of progress portending that an intelligent public is
                            taking a greater intérest than here- tofore in the affairs of the
                            country. Such opinion, in the near future, will manifest itself in the
                            initiation of useful reforms upon popular lines, and the suppression of
                            abuses which necessarily occur with increasing frequency when a
                            government is left to itself unchecked by non-official and unprejudiced
                            criticism. </p>

                        <p>Sir, In view of the many allusions in your columns to the disgraceful
                            condition of the main streets of Cairo, I think it is high time the
                            Tanzim authorities were "hauled over the coals" for their apparent lack
                            of supervision. As a matter of fact, there is no supervision at all, and
                            there is in addition the fact that their alackness in causing very
                            serious inconvenience and loss to the tradespeople in certain districts.
                            It is even said that some action is contemplated to sue the Government
                            for such loss to business. I may mention that on the 3rd inst. the work
                            on the road at Ataba el-Khadra, opposite the Wakfs buildings, was
                            commenced and was promised to be completed in 3 or 4 days at the
                            outside. It is not yet finished. It appears there may not be any
                            reliance on the word of the authorities. </p>
                        <p>To go further, Clot Bey-the most frequent- ed thoroughfare in Cairo has
                            been in a to- tally impassable state for months; first one side was
                            hauled up for water pipes, then the other for gas or something else. Now
                            one side is completely impassable; it is all dug up for a depth of about
                            25 centimetres -this is presumably for the new lines and the asphalte
                            that have been promised. When, oh! when will our streets be fit to be
                            used again? </p>

                    <head>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE <lb/> "LA FORZA DEL DESTINO."</head>
                    <p>The production last evening of this favourite old opera of Verdi was an
                        unqualified success. Each of the artistes was successful in his or her role,
                        the choruses were, as usual, given with a finish not far from perfection and
                        showed signs of very careful training, the orchestra was perfect, and the
                        attention paid to minor detail throughout the opera was highly commendable.
                        Surely such excellence as was displayed on every side is deserving of more
                        liberal support than it has hitherto received, and it is to be hoped that
                        Alexandrians will not fail to recognise that if such excellent fare is to be
                        provided at so moderate a price, they must come forward and support the
                        efforts of the enterprising management who are catering so well for their
                        amusement and pleasure. What could have been more delightfully rendered than
                        the several numbers in the second act, where Signs Popovici and Sig.
                        Baldelli sang with such magnificent effect, and were so admirably supported
                        by the members of the chorus, noticeably in the prayer song! Indeed, the
                        whole of the music in the second act was throughout so artistically
                        rendered, and such depth of feeling was displayed, that without doubt the
                        audience would willingly have listened to its repetition from beginning to
                        end. Improvement in this net particularly, we think, could hardly have been
                        possible. The Donna Leonors of Signorinas H. Popovici was a charming
                        impersonation and captivated the sympathies of her audience im- mediately.
                        In addition to being an accomplish- ed vocalist, this lady possessos
                        histrionic ability of a high order. Signs. Cecchi was very sue- cessful in
                        the role of Preziosilla and met with some hearty applause in the third act.
                        As Padre Guardiano Francescano, Signor Mariano Baldelli was perfect, his
                        magnificent voice being heard to great advantage. Sig. Pietro Venerandi, as
                        Don Alvaro, and Sig. Cattadori, as Don Carlo, were equally successful in
                        their respective characters, and secured rounds of well-merited applause
                        throughout the opera, while Signor Barrione, as Fra Militone, was decidedly
                        amusing. The minor characters were in good hands, and the opera went with a
                        swing from start to finish. </p>
