                    <head>THE SETTLEMENT OF THE QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>The satisfactory alleviation of the terrible state of tension which has
                        prevailed throughout the last week, in consequence of the Baltic Fleet
                        outrage, is a matter for the congratulation to the whole world, and as our
                        telegrams announced yesterday, the Continental Press is unanimous in
                        welcoming the agreement for the settlement of this incident by pacific
                        methods. We in Egypt have also special cause for congratulating ourselves on
                        the happy issue, for there is no doubt that had was ensued between England
                        and Russia the coming season would have been in a great measure ruined. But
                        there are larger and more permanent considerations involved in this
                        submission to peaceful settlement, inasmuch as it acknowledges the power of
                        arbitration to settle international disputes, even when they happen to
                        involve questions of vital interest and national honour. As germane to this
                        subject reference may be made to the important article on the settlement of
                        international differences in the latest Fortnightly Review to hand from the
                        able pen of Sir Thomas Barclay, who has had great practical experience in
                        preparing such treaties. It is to be noted, in the first place, that from
                        treaties of arbitration are excluded matters involving the "vital interests"
                        or "national honour" of either party, which is the exclusion of the very
                        matters which seem the only ones capable of influencing public opinion to a
                        dangerous point. What is a "vital interest?" The independence of a state
                        itself is a vital interest. A deliberate breach in the established usage of
                        nations of fundamental importance might be vital to one state and not to
                        another. "Vital," of course, means something of such gravity that it cannot
                        be settled by an award of damages, in which, in other words, there is no
                        solution but reversion to the status quo ante. "National honour" is very
                        like a "vital interest" but it generally arises out of the overheated
                        discussion of some questions which was originally a judicial one. Every
                        question <cb n="6"/> can become one of national honour in the hands of an
                        unskilled diplomacy, and very often what is called national honour is merely
                        the outcome of a one-sided view of a question in which honour plays a very
                        little part. On the other hand, does it much detract from the value of these
                        new treaties that there is a loophole offered by which either nation can
                        escape in an emergency from its obligations? Treaties between nations cannot
                        be viewed exactly in the same light as contracts between individuals. The
                        best we can offer as their sanction is the sense of honour and justice
                        between the contracting parties, and it will always be better to escape from
                        a treaty through its own provisions than by violating them. Peaceable
                        adjustment of differences in the dealings of nations with each other has
                        been the dream of every enlightened man who ever thought upon the subject.
                        The Alabama case, the establishment of a Permanent Court of Judicature at
                        The Hague, and the new obilgation entered into by Great Britain and France,
                        so rapidly followed by others, to submit all their differences of a judicial
                        order to The Hague Tribunal, are the three events which stand out as
                        landmarks of progress towards that ideal.</p>
                    <p>Crtics of these treaties have not understood what the practical effect of an
                        obligatory treaty of arbitration is. They view a treaty of arbitration in
                        the light of a restraint placed upon the contracting Governments. They
                        assume that Governments are bloodthirsty ogres only too anxious to plunge
                        their countries into fire and blooshed, and that a muzzle has to be put upon
                        them and that they only yeild to pressure and negociate such treaties with
                        reluctance. It is indeed a grave mistake to think that democratic
                        Governments, at the present day, can afford to view arbitration with
                        distrust. Foreign offices and diplomatists may have misgivings about
                        details, even very essential details, but they can have little objection to
                        pacific methods of any kind for the settlement of international differences
                        as they can have to the whole protocol system of diplomacy. Diplomacy has no
                        raison d'etre but that it is itself a pacific method, and its history has
                        been one of constantly adding of varieties to its provision of devices for
                        keeping a question open. A permanent treaty of arbitration is an additional
                        device in the hands of diplomacy for this purpose. It is not a shackle
                        impeding the free activity of the diplomatist, but an instrument in his
                        hands by which ha can make another last endeavour to settle any difficulty
                        when all his other instruments have proved unavailing. It is usual to speak
                        of arbitration as applicable "when diplomacy has failed," as in the Hague
                        Peace Convention, the treaty of 1897, etc., but it is evident that diplomacy
                        must be the medium of negotiation for this further stage in pacific efforts.
                        The de facto position "when diplomacy ahs failed," is that the diplomatist
                        is recalled by his Government, and there is then little hope of peace but in
                        the mediation of an independent Government and its acceptance by the two
                        parties. With a permanent treaty of arbitration in existence between the two
                        parties, the danger of such a breakdown is, at any rate, poatponed. The
                        diplomatist is not recalled. The only difference is that negotiations are
                        turned into a new channel, in accordance with the terms of the treaty. Under
                        the provisions of these new treaties there will be a number of questions for
                        diplomacy to settle. First of all, there is the question of whether any
                        "vital interest" or "national honour" is involved, and if not, and the
                        question is determined be judicial order, the exact subject of dispute will
                        have to be settled – that is to say, the subject will have to be narrowed
                        down to a precise issue, and even then the powers of the arbitrators and the
                        details of procedure will have to be fixed. All this means machinery at the
                        disposal of the diplomatist. When in 1856 the Treaty of Paris was under
                        discussion, Mr. Gladstone said, "No country ought to resort to arbitration
                        until it had reduced its claims to that</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div type="page" n="3"

                    <cb n="1"/>
                    <p>condition in which they were fit to be supported y force." It will be for the
                        diplomatists under these treaties to reduce the respective claims of their
                        Governments to the minimum, to bring them down to the essential point of
                        points beyond which neither Government will give way. In many cases,
                        probably this whittling process will suggest solution, as in private
                        litigation, and they will be "settled out of court."</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it would be mere optimism to think the diplomatist in this
                        further stage of negotiations will always be successful. There are
                        diplomatists of the "new school," who like to carry on their business in the
                        broad light of day, and think the hand-claps of an audience help them to
                        their task. There are others – and thank goodness they are the majority –
                        who prefer the more noble and, as history has proved, more successful
                        methods by which diplomacy has earned an honourable and a commendable
                        meaning. Lord Dufferin once observed that war, in his opinion, was generally
                        an accident of diplomacy. To avoid such accidents, men trained in the
                        courtesy of nations, and gifted with the necessary graces of mind and
                        manner, and with resourcefulness – the most essential quality of the
                        diplomatists – should of course be selected to fill, at any rate, the more
                        delicate positions. Mistakes inherent to things human can be laid to the
                        charge of most Governments in their choice of representatives; one of the
                        advantages of permanent treaties of arbitration will be to make errors
                        remediable. It is not, by the way, without its lesson that the United States
                        Governments select their diplomatic representatives from among men of the
                        whole party who seem to the President, by their natural gifts and character,
                        and experience and knowledge of their country's practical affairs, best
                        adapted for each responsible post. It is certain that the United States have
                        not been able, in spite of certain shortcomings, through their diplomatic
                        representatives, to make friends for their country all over the world. The
                        best engine can be driven inefficiently. The Anglo-French Treaty, in the
                        hands of a skilled driver, is quite a storehouse of resources for the
                        prolongation of negotitations. We may assume that when a difficulty arises
                        the object of the one or the other Government will be from the very first
                        peace or war. If it be peace, they will have ample means of removing the
                        subject from the danger of acute public contoversy. National passions, like
                        most other nervous maladies, are generally curable if left to the benign
                        influence of time. To gain time in an emergency is generally the difficulty.
                        The Anglo-French Treaty will certainly enable the Governemnts, if they wish
                        to profit by it, to gain all the time they want. The employment of paicifc
                        methods in arranging international difficulties in a commanding event in the
                        history of the progress of civilisation, and is one of the greatest works
                        with which statesmen can couple their names. "The greatest of British
                        interests is peace." At any rate, it is a "vital interest" of the democratic
                        elements of every nation, and the satisfactory solution of last week's
                        incident, whereby a Russian Trafalgar has been averted, should be acclaimed
                        by all who have the interests of international comity at heart. Just as
                        England was the pioneer of civilisation in her efforts to suppress the slave
                        trade, so here again she will be found in the vanguard of nations desirous
                        of maintaining the world's peace, and the entire civilised world should be
                        grateful from draing the sword when our national honour and sense of
                        humanity had been so deeply wounded by the piratical escapades of the Baltic
                        fleet.</p>

                        as Schweinfurth – that "Niam-Niam" is nothing more than the nickname
                        bestowed by the Arabs in imitation of the sound made by the A-Zandeh when
                        enjoying one of their cannibal feasts. It is to the Arabs, by the way, that
                        we owe the common word Kaffir – i.e., and unbeliever in Mohamed.</p>

                    <head>NIAM-NIAM EXPEDITION.</head>
                    <p>UNFOUNDED REPORTS.</p>
                    <p>A number of our English contemporaries published the following telegram from
                        Cairo last week:– </p>
                    <p>"The expedition to the Niam-Niam country has now been definitely decided
                        upon, and, as already stated, it will be composed of about two thousend
                        Sudanese troops under British officers. The base of the expedition will be
                        Wao, in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. Stores are now being rapidly accumulated there.
                        It is hoped to make a start some time in December. It is now believed the
                        Niam-Niams have a force of fully 15,000 fighting men.</p>
                    <p>"Major Boulnois, R.A., of the Egyptian Army, will take command of the
                        expedition. His force will consist of a company of Mounted Infantry, the 9th
                        and the 10th Sudanese battalions, and half of the 15th battalion, with
                        Maxims.</p>
                    <p>"It will be remembered that in February of this year Major Boulnois, with a
                        force of about 1,000 men, attempted to reach the Niam-Niam country, but in
                        view of the threatening attitude of the inhabitants and the smallness of his
                        force he was compelled to retire. The Niam-Niams are a vigorous Sudanese
                        race, very jealous of their independence, and likely to resent any attempt
                        on the part of the Government of the Sudan to enter into relations with
                        them. They have Remington rifles, and also use bows and poisoned arrows. The
                        country is most difficult, being covered with long grass, and the paths
                        which intersect it are so narrow that it is only possible to march in a
                        single file. Water, however, is said to be plentiful."</p>
                    <p>We can only say that the above statements are greatly exaggerated. On enquiry
                        at official sources we learn that there is no question of a campaign against
                        the whole of the Niam-Niam tribe. The above story probably originated from
                        the fact that the Sirdar and Major Boulnois are going shortly on an
                        inspection of the Bahr-el-Ghazal garrison, and Yambio, gave some trouble to
                        the authorities a few months ago.</p>

                        granted by the Egyptian Government, for the purpose of providing manures, is
                        proceeding apace. An engineer from England has recently been inspecting the

                        the necessary material. The machinery will be shipped from England in a few

                        I did not join Mr. Wells as a leader in his expedition, neither was the
                        expedition intended to demonstrate the validity of my company's claims. Mr.

                        passing through my company's territory on his way South and East, and would
                        halt at Um Garaiart to rest and water his camels, and I took the opportunity
                        of riding with him from Assouan to Um Garaiart, where I have since

                    <head>MOTOR TRACTION FOR CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>An application has been addressed to the Ministry of Public Works for
                        permission to institute a service of motor wagons for the transport of sand
                        and stones from the quarries in the neighbourhood of the Capital. Messrs.
                        Theocaridis and Adamidis, of Alexandria, are the applicants.</p>
                    <p>While the question of motor wagons is under consideration, it is worth while
                        asking why some energetic capitalist does not also apply for a permit to
                        work motor 'buses in Cairo. The present 'buses are eyesores as vehicles,
                        cumbersome in construction, constantly obstructing traffic, and far too
                        heavy for the miserable quadrupeds which have to draw them. We understand
                        that the Omnibus Company is composed of some of the most influential
                        capitalists in Cairo and it returns a substantial dividend of, so rumor hath
                        it, about 80 per cent. per annum. A 4 share in this company is now worth 20,
                        so there should be every chance for successfully launching a motor omnibus
                        company, as there are many streets in Cairo, especially in the native
                        quarters, which can never be tapped by the Tramway Company. Moreover, many
                        of the narrow streets in the native quarters, where a small motor 'bus
                        carrying sixteen passengers could circulate, would not be available for the
                        cumberous omnibuses now in vogue.</p>

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN ADVENTURER</head>
                    <p>HIS EXPLOITS IN PARIS.</p>
                    <p>A Paris corespondent writes under date of the 23rd inst:– </p>
                    <p>An Egyptian adventurer, who gave himself out as Prince George, and is said to
                        be the son of a Cairo diamond merchant, has been tried and convicted for
                        swindling Paris jewellers and dealers in precious stones. This man, who
                        lived in a garret of the slums, was able by his representation to obtain on
                        credit rubies, diamonds, pearls, and sapphires from nearly a dozen dealers.
                        From one jeweller alone he had goods worth 2,000. The sham prince was well
                        known in the world of amusement. He associated with actresses, variety
                        artists, circus riders, tight-rope dancers, and several demi-mondaines,
                        including Blondinette Daleza, who was brought forward prominently in the
                        romance of the phantom millions as the friend of Romain Daurignac, Madame
                        Humbert's gay brother. Mdlle. Daleza, who has appeared occasionally on the
                        stage, was called as a witness yesterday in the Ninth Correctional Chamber,
                        where "Prince George," the Egyptian, was tried. She said that she knew the
                        prince cheifly through his little friend, Madame Karat, of the Marigny
                        Theatre. George was presented to Mdlle. Daleza at the Cascade Restaurant in
                        the Peir de Boulogne, and she subsequently saw him waiting for Madame Karat
                        at the Marigny rehearsals. One day George put two valuable rings on Madame
                        Karat's fingers. "Did he ever put any on yours?" queried the President of
                        the Court. "No," said Blondinette, "he never gave me anything. A few days
                        ago he came to me, and asked me to tell his little friend Karat that he was
                        called away suddenly to Brussels." Also, in answer to the President, Mdlle.
                        Daleza said that George spent a lot of money, and lived like a man who had
                        12,000 a year. He hired a carriage and pair for Karat, and had for himself a
                        luxurious motor-car of the most modern make. The Egyptian was sentenced to
                        imprisonment for two years and a fine of 20, this being the maximum penalty
                        in his case.</p>
