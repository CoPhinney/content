                    <p> The Russian Press has been very active lately in demanding the instand
                        despatch of a part, at least, of the Black Sea Squadron to join or follow
                        Admiral Rodjestvensky's fleet on a cruise to Eastern waters. Greay Britain,
                        according to most Russian journalists, is the sole Power that will make any
                        diplomatic objections to the passing of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles by the
                        Russian division, and Captain Klado, since then under fifteen days arrese,
                        informs his public that the British foreign polocy is now a matter of snarls
                        and grimaces, alarming but scarcely to be called dangerous. Whether the
                        Black Sea Fleet is in a condition to reach Far Eastern waters we leave to
                        naval experts to decide, but the calm assumption that Great Britain will
                        permit a squadron to pass in defiance of  treaty obligations and endanger
                        the very existance of her ally, would be amusing were it not part of a
                        scheme to sow dissention between the two naval Powers. The Muscovite Press,
                        always awaiting inspiration, has shown remarkable unamity in denouncing the
                        "perfidy" shown by England in her tretament of her unfortunate ally. The
                        case of the Caroline, the fact that British shippers have industriously
                        supplied the Port Arthur garrison with provisions, the shipping of coal for
                        the Baltic Fleet from Cardiff, the placing of a Russian order of

                    <p>Dardanelles will, in the opinion of Russian journalists, be viewed with
                        resignation, if not with complacency, by a perjured Government. </p>
                    <p>"In vain is the net spread in the sight of the bird." The Japanese are
                        unlikely to be duped by these statements or appalled by the menace of the
                        Black Sea Squadron, and though Russian statesmen inform eager journalisrts
                        that We shall astonish the world by out moderation in the hour of victory,
                        the hour of victory has not yet come, and Japan remains unmoved in her
                        determination to check the Russian advance on Korea and N. China. Meanwhile,
                        the Dardanelles question may yet cause trouble. Austria is interedted in
                        protecting the Russian ingress to the Mediterranean, but to the suzerains of
                        Egypt the very possibility is unpleasant to think of. A Russian fleet
                        allowed free ingress and egress to and from the Black Sea would enable the
                        Tsar's Govermnent to levy blackmail on Constantinople, while the Power that
                        is now in occupation in Egypt cannot be indifferent to the risk of a naval
                        raid on Egypt or the Syrian Coast in the absense of the whole or part of the
                        Mediterranean squadron. The naval balance of power has shifted North, our
                        next naval combat may be in the Atlantic, and should the treaty clauses,
                        that forbid the Black Sea Fleet to pass the Kavals, be ever aborgated, the
                        fortification of Port-Said and Alexandria, or better, a large increase of
                        the Mediterranean Squadron, will be necessary. </p>

                    <head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS</head>
                    <p> We understand that Sir Horace Pinching'd reply to the Cairo pharmacists'
                        committee will be delivered to-day or to-morrow. It is being awaited with
                        great interest, and it will be interesting to see whether its decisions
                        satisfy the majority of those concerned. The point at issue netween the
                        Sanitary Department and the pharmacists is this. Are persons who have no
                        knowledge whatever of drugs and their properties to be allowed to control
                        pharmacies? The pharmacists, for the most part, urge that this should be
                        forbidden, and that, in accordance with the practice usual in all
                        Continental countries, no person should be allowed to own a pharmacy without
                        holding a pharmaceutical diploma. Sir Horace Pinching, on the other hand,
                        takes the view that no such qualifications should be demanded of the
                        proprietor qui proprietor, but that, should he have anything whatever to do
                        with the management od the pharmacy or pharmacies which are his property, he
                        must first satisfy the Sanitary Department that he possesses expert
                        knowledge. Should he not possess this, he cannpt interfere in any way with
                        the management of the shop, and must leave this to a qualified pharmacist.
                        The Director-General of the Sanitary Department holds that these conditions
                        will elsure the safety of the public as dar as is humanly possible, and
                        quotes Englans and the United States as countries where the proprietor of a
                        chemist's shop is not necessarily an expert, but where the management is all
                        that concernt the articles solely is in expert hands. The pharmacists of
                        Cairo seem inclined to argue that the conditions in these counteies differ
                        widely from those in Egypt, and that in practice it will be difficult or
                        impossible to prevent the interference of the proprietor, if he should be
                        minded to interfere. Will an expert-assistant risk the loss of hisplace, of
                        his proprietor chooses to overstep the limits laid down in the new Pharmacy
                        Regulations? </p>

                    <p>Book on Egypt.--"The Agricultural Wealth of Egypt and the Sudan" is the title
                        of a brochure written by Mr. Charles Tuchmann, It deals largely with the
                        importance and prospects of cotton-growing in these territories, and with
                        the rubber, gum, and mineral productions of the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Mishap To P. &amp; O. STEAMER.- The P. &amp;0. S.S. Sardinia (Capt. C. C.
                        Talbot, R.N.R.) arrived at Port Said on Monday evening after a difficult
                        passage through the Canal with only one propeller, the other having been
                        lost while anchoring in Suez Bay. She has proceeded on her voyage to London
                        with the remaining propeller, her speed being reduced to 8 knots.</p>

                        and a Half per Ct. Deb. stock. They have also ordered the above-mentioned

                    <p>GUARANTEES.-The public confidence is always in proportion to the given

                        than riches." We may say that much of the success of the Berlitz schools is
                        due to the universal reputation of its admirable method. The results already
                        obtained in Egypt, by the pupils who have been learning English, French,
                        German, Italian, etc., eto., are an ample proof of the success of these
                        schools in Alexandria (26, Rue Eglise Copte), and at Cairo (1, Sharia
                        Kamel). (Advt.).</p>

                        Work in London.” We understand that the kind of work that formed the subject
                        of our leading article last Saturday will be fully dealt with by the
                        lecturer, who will have much to say of great importance to all interested in
                        philanthropic work, espe. cially that done in the direction of rescuing
                        destitute and waif children from their wretched surroundings, and giving
                        them the chance of becoming respectable members of society. We hope to see a
                        large attendance of members of the Alexandria Literary, Musical, and
                        Dramatic Society and their friends. Members will be admitted free,

                    <head>YOUSBASHI ARMSTRONG'S DEATH</head>
                    <p>The greatest astonishment has been caused owing to the circumstances
                        attending the death of Yousbashi Armstrong, which, as we announced on
                        Monday, took place at the German Deaconesses' Hospital, Alexandria, on
                        Sunday. Only a few days ago the deceased was getting on well, and wrote to
                        his friends that he was on the way to recovery from the attack { scarlet
                        fever from which he had been suffering. He was judged by his doctor to be
                        convalescent and had been allowed to see some of his acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>The question at once occurs by what mishance he could have caught one of the
                        most horrible forms of infectious malady known to humanity, for the
                        small-pox to which he fell victim was the most loathsome type of that ill
                        disease. Lately he had written to his friends full of hope as to his speedy
                        departure from the hospital. When, therefore, it was announced last week
                        that he had contracted a fresh disease, the news was received with
                        astonishment. He was so much liked, and such a good type of a young
                        Englishman, that the circumstances attending his sudden death have caused a
                        great deal of poignant interest to a large circle of his friends and
                        acquaintances in the English colony here. But in justice to the German
                        Hospital at Alexandria it may be ated that in England no small-pox hospital
                        is considered safe within a distance of half a mile so infectious is that
                        disease. A case of smallpox was being treated at the hospital while
                        Yousbashi Armstrong was convalescent, and he must have caught the infection
                        in the air, -at least so it is presumed.</p>

                        toujours votre rôle, mais vous avez toujours su appliquer la Loi avec une
                        telle bienveillance dans les procédés, vous avez montré dans vos rapports
                        avec nous, une telle urbanité et une i juste compréhension de vos devoirs,
                        que vous avez conquis les profondes sympathies de tout le commerce dont nous
                        sommes aujourd'hui kas interprètes et dont nous sommes chargés de vous
                        transmettre les sincères rendements. Ce sont là des traditions que vous avez

                        branches du Commerce d'Importation de notre Ville tiennent bien vouloir me

                        sympathie que nous vous prions d'accepter à l'occasion de votre départ comme
                        Directeur Local de la Douane d'Alexandrie. Plus que mes paroles, l'adresse,
                        signée par tous les souscripteurs, que nous avons l'honneur de vous
                        présenter, vous exprimera mieux encore les sentiments et les vifs regrets
                        que vous avez su inspirer au Commerce d'Importation en particulier. S'il ne
                        nous a pas été permis de nous acquitter plus tôt du mandat dont nous étions
                        chargés, ce retard est attribuable à l'exode estival d'abord, et, surtout,
                        au désir des Membres du Comité d'être ici tous présents.</p>

                    <p>
                        Professor Reisner, the well-known Egyptologist, writes to us from the Pyramids, where, as we announced, he is conducting some in"teresting excavations. He draws our attention to the fact that Professor Flinders Petrie's interest in the malachite mines of Sinai is purely archäological, and his present expedition, undertaken as usual on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and approved. by that society, has a scientific purpose only. Our announcement of the professor's expedition to the malachite mines did not necessarily imply that his object was commercial instead of antiquarian. We expressed a hope that the expedition would result in reviving the export of that beautiful stone, for in Egypt, where every new development is only a re-discovery, the antiquary must precede the exploiter, as was the case with the ancient gold mines.

                    <p>A very interesting work is to be issued in Paris shortly dealing with the
                        Egyptian | antiquities in the Sinaitic peninsula. The ancient Egyptian
                        inscriptions are numerous there, but no complete description of them has yet
                        been published. Lepsius and Lottin de Laval, about 1850, issued the first
                        collection of Sinaitic inscriptions, and an English expedition in 1868
                        published some photographic reproductions of their discoveries. That there
                        are many other finds awaiting the careful explorer silenced by the
                        comparatively recent discoveries of Euringer and Borchatt, who, on a brief
                        visit to the old mining districts of the peninsula, found a number of new
                        inscriptions. M. Weill had for a long time believed that an important
                        collection of documents from the English mission of 1868 was to be found in
                        the British Museum, and be set about a search there which ended in the
                        discovery of a splendid series of inscriptions which had been lying
                        neglected for 30 years. This collection is to be republished by M. Weill and
                        it will form ope of the finest Egypto| logical works ever published.</p>

                    <p>Helouan December 13. </p>
                    <p>The present season at Helouan promises to be one of the best this famous
                        health resort has ever known.</p>
                    <p>Among the latest arrival at the Grand Hotel we notice Baron and Baroness

                    <p>Medinet el-Fayoum, December 12, </p>
                    <p>Mr. Machell arrived here by last night's train and made an official
                        inspection of the town this morning accompanied by the Moudir. At 2.30 he
                        left for Lahoon, taking with him Major Elgood, Inspector for Fayoum. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Machell did not have time to go through the province and visit the
                        different villages in order to ascertain if the inhabitants are contented,
                        or to hear any complaints they might want to make. He only saw the town,
                        which of course was made read for his expected visit. He will spend the
                        night in his dahabieh at Sidment el Gohel and is expected to reach Cairo
                        to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>THE GHAFFIR QUESTION. </p>
                    <p>It is now proposed to appoint ghaffirs both for day and night duty and to
                        employ retired soldiers for the service. It is understood that this plan is
                        approved by the Adviser,</p>
                    <p>IRRIGATION. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Clowes, the newly-appointed Inspector-General for Upper Egypt, is
                        expected here to-night. I understand that an Englishman is to replace the
                        native moudir of the Fayoum Irrigation works, and that the pay of the
                        district engineers is to be increased next year. This should put a stop to
                        their receiving backsheesh, and anyone taking it should in future be
                        severely punished.</p>

                        some of them, stationed in the three markazes of Keneh, Kous, and Luxor. Mr.
                        McKillop is making a tour of inspection of the work of the maoween in these
                        markazes. It is said the commission will complete the adjustment of the
                        Keneh Mordirieh land taxes within 7 months, i.e., by next June.</p>
                    <p>Another commission is to be appointed after this one has finished its
                        labours. It will be composed of the Sub-Moudir, as president, and two or
                        three experienced codehs, to enquire into any complaints that may be made by
                        agriculturists in connection with the increase of taxes on their lands.</p>

                    <p>Luxor, December 10. Mr. Shinuda Magarius, the consular agent. of
                        Austria-Hungary, has died at his residence at Luxor. Much regret is felt by
                        all who knew this gentleman at the loss sustained by his death.</p>
                    <p>A large number of Sudanese cattle and sheep are being sold in the market
                        here. The animals are in great demand among the butchers as well as the
                        farmers, owing to the great scarcity of cattle consequent on the plague's
                        ravages.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that these imports will have some effect in lowering the price of
                        meat, which has reached an unprecedentedly high price.</p>
