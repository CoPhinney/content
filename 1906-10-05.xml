                    <head>The Sultan's Successor</head>
                    <p>The Constantinople correspondent of the "Tribune" in a recent letter to our
                        contemporary concerning the much discussed question of the succession to the
                        throne of Turkey writes as follows:—For some weeks there have mysterious
                        rumours of the possibility of an attempt to change the succession to the
                        Turkish throre. The most persistent is that it is the desire of Abdul Hamid
                        to appoint his third son, Prince Burhan-ed-din, as his successor, and for
                        this purpose to obtain the consent of the Sheik-ul Islam and of the
                        Ambassadors of the Great Powers. It is even added that Abdul Hamid is
                        thinking of abdicating in favour of this prince. The rumoured step would be
                        an exceedingly grave one. It is probable that any attempt to make such a
                        change without the consent of the ulema class, of whom the Sheik. al-Islam
                        is the head, would fail, and might simply plange the country into
                        revolution. It is further rumoured that the Sheik-ul-Islam has seen sounded,
                        and that he has declared that such a change could never be sanctioned. This,
                        however, I do not believe. Rumour further says that the German Emperor has |
                        been asked for his counsel, and that the sudden return here, &amp; week ago,
                        of the German Ambassador is in connection with this question. While fully
                        admitting that we are dealing only with rumours, these are so persistent and
                        definite as to suggest that they have a basis of truth, and the questions
                        raised by them become interesting and important.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem law of succession to a royal throne is based upon long usage, and
                        enacts that the heir is the oldest male in the Royal for Imperial family. A
                        simple illustration is furnished by the recent history of Egypt. When Mehmet
                        Ali became, by Imperial firman and the recognition of Europe, Khedive of
                        Egypt, the Sultan issued a firman in 1846 by which the succession was to be
                        regulated] in the Moslem fashion--that is, the heir was always to be the
                        eldest male descended from Mehmet Ali. The rule was strictly followed till
                        the time of Ismail. On the death of Ismail the legal heir to the Khedival
                        throne should have been Prince Halim, the youngest son of Mehmet Ali. But
                        Ismail, in 1866, by means of very heavy payments, had induced Abdul Aziz,
                        the Sultan of Turkey (who was deposed, and 'suicided" in 1876), to grant a
                        new firman,, by which the succession was changed from the Moslem to the
                        general European system of succession. When the representatives of England
                        and France decided in 1879 to get rid of Ismail, they secretly, but
                        unmistakably, gave him the opportunity to leave Egypt quietly, in which case
                        the firman which he had obtained would be recognized, and his son allowed to
                        reign in his stead. If he refused, Halim, the "de jure'' heir by Moslem law,

                        believed in this city that Abdul Aziz, in granting the firman changing the
                        Egyptian succession, had the intention to change the succession to the
                        Turkish throne. In such case Prince Yussuf Izzedin would have been the heir
                        apparent, Tho revolution of 1876 put an end to any such design, and Murad,
                        and then the present occupant, were girded with the Sword of Osman in
                        conformity with the well-established rule. At the time, however, when the
                        project of changing the Ottoman rule of succession was in the air, it was

                    <head>The Sultan's Successor Cont.</head>
                    <p>understood that the ulema clans were strongly opposed to it. They represent
                        the conservative element of Islam ; and unless some very special
                        circumstances should be brought forward, they would oppose a stout
                        resistance to any change of the kind. The present heir to the throne is
                        Reshad Effendi, the Sultan's brother. Both he and two elder brothers rank,
                        on the ground of age, before the third son of the present Sultan. The
                        supposed favourite of his Majesty for the succession is his third son, who
                        is known to the Ambassadors as a bright and intelligent young man of about
                        twenty years old. The question is mainly, though not exclusively, of course,
                        one for the subjects of his Majesty, and especially for his Monlem |
                        subjects. If the change is attempted, it will probably give rise to
                        considerable trouble. -</p>
                    <p>The suggestion that Abdul Hamid would be willing to abdicate does not strike
                        me as probable. Those who are in favour of his doing so speak disparagingly
                        of Reshad Effendi; but there will be always a party strongly in his favour
                        as representing the reign of Moslema law. There are precedents for passing
                        over the heir, but the change has always been regarded as revolutionary.</p>
                    <p>Though, of course, the personality of the Sultan is for foreign States a
                        matter of great importance, the representatives of such States will probably
                        best consult the interests of their Governments, and certainly of Turkey, by
                        having nothing to do with any proposal to change the succession. The fact
                        that they or any of them favoured one candidate more than another would do
                        much to make him un- popular with the Moslem population. The matter is
                        primarily one for the Moslem people of Turkey, and for a foreign Govern.
                        ment to pronounce an opinion one way or another would have the appearance of
                        mixing in a Palace intrigue. If it be said that Turkey is more or less under
                        European tutelage, and that the unanimous consent of Europe to s change of
                        Moslem law would give it a sanction which would secure its general
                        acceptance, my reply would be that unanimity on this subject is impossible,
                        and to attempt to obtain it would occasion endless intrigue. It may be
                        admitted that if the general consent of Europe could be obtained it might
                        establish an important precedent. But if such consent has been applied for,
                        and il, as is rumoured, negotiations are going on, it is because opposition
                        is anticipated either by Turkey or by some foreign State. Even an attempt by
                        the Concert of Europe would be denounced by the Moslem population as an
                        interference by the giaours with their religious rights, | There is much to
                        be said for and much against the alleged project. The generally expressed
                        opinion is that certain Palace favourites, for their own purposes, are in
                        its favour, and this would not recommend it to the Turkish population, and
                        still less to Europeans. Indeed, in whatever way the expe. diency of a
                        change in the law of succession may be regarded, its practical application
                        will be dangerous. It will almost certainly lead to disturbances, and it
                        ought to be a question for Turkish statesmen whether it is desirable to add
                        to the many difficulties with which they have to deal a possible war of
                        succession. For foreign States the question is at once tempting and
                        dangerous. In the solution of the many questions in the Near East with which
                        our country is concerned, it is difficult to see what advantage could be
                        gained by entering upon it. Sir Edward Grey will probably conclude that his
                        wisest course is to reserve speech or action, and take up the poste tion
                        that Great Britain will stand aloof, and neither approve nor disapprove any
                        action of the kind which the Palace advisers may choose to take.</p>

                    <p>"Al Minbar" states in its issue of yesterday that it has received an official
                        communication announcing that the journal will not be admitted into the
                        Sadun. We can only express approval at the action of the Sudan Government in
                        view of the immoderation with which to "Al Minbar" discusses political
                        question relating to the occupying Power. The organa of the nationalist
                        party have assumed the foolish course of indulging in mere tirade against
                        the advisers of the Khedive, and by such bring upon themselves the
                        possibility of a perfectly justifiable suppression. We are rather inclined
                        to hope that the prohibition of such intemperate journals in the Sudan is an
                        augury of the application of a censorship over the Press of Egypt. It is
                        exceedingly regrettable that there should be cause to seriously consider
                        such an innovation, but a certain section, which is not constituted by our
                        vernacular contemporaries alone, bas become so seditious that we should feel
                        ourselves obliged to support the Government in any means which they might
                        deem necessary to check the violent and harmful declamations of unreasoning
                        journaliste. Let such take a lesson from the suppression of "Al Minbar" in
                        the Sudan, and learn that their turbulence may preclude them from the
                        liberty which moderation would ansare and from the consideration of serious
                        men.</p>

                        notifying! that Onbashi Mohamed Taha and shawish Ibrahim Abd-el-Aal, who

                        the policemen Mohamed Taha and Ibrahim Abdel Aal are quite blameless on the
                        ground that medical reports show that the death of the deceased was due to
                        internal disease. The trial of the accused held by the Council of Discipline
                        contains no evidence to incriminate the onbashi and shawish, and, moreover,
                        the two witnesses being of the deceased's relatives, who prepared the charge
                        against the policemen, their evidence can not be considered and furthermore
                        the supposition that the policemen treated the man with some cruelty in the
                        course of their duties affords, insufficient ground to incriminate them.</p>

                        will return by way of fort Nakhl on the way to Suez, from whence they will
                        proceed direct to Cairo. We are assured that the relations between the Anglo
                        Egyptian and Ottoman commissioners were extremely friendly. On the other
                        hand, Mr. Keeling, of the Barvey Department, who was attached to the
                        Commission, had a narrow escape between Akaba and Kuseima, at the hands of a
                        raiding party of Bedouins, who had crossed the frontier in to attack one of
                        the Bedouin tribes under Egyptian protection. As Mr. Kooling's guide
                        belonged to the latter tribe his position might have proved very dangerous,
                        but the Bedouins fortunately did not press their enquiries too close by Mr.

                        to forget that he has sown the seeds of discord between Moslem and Copt,
                        between Egyptian and Syrian ; that he bas declared England to be the deadly

                    <head>BLUNT'S ANTI-NATIONALSIM</head>
                    <p>HIS BIASSED CRITICISMS.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes as follows</p>
                    <p>You published the day before yesterday a letter to the “Times" from the pen
                        of Mr. Blant, who therein expresses has "onlooked for pleasure" at finding
                        himself "once more attacked, after a silence of some twenty years” by his
                        old adversary, Mr. Moberly Bell. One can fully understand Mr. Blant's
                        delight at the advertisement which he has received from a journal than which
                        none other in the world stands higher, and were it not impossible to
                        disregard the aspersions by which he tries to vilify his mother-dation, the
                        publicity which he has received would be regrettable. Righteous indignation
                        rankles in th: best of every true Britisher at the calomnies which are cast
                        upon his nation by distorted fasts emanating from one of the Empire's song.
                        Were Mr. Blunt content to criticise his country in an equitable spirit, to
                        endeavour to obtain true and unbiased accounts of the happenings in Egypt,
                        and to moderate his acrimony, one might read lo with interest and seriously
                        consider his I writing. But his obvious hatred for his country makes one
                        feel that it is impossible to wage with him the war of pens with the feeling
                        that he is an adversary worthy of the steel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blant's asseveration that the "Times" exaggerates his anti English
                        attitude cannot be accepted, as, in the opinion of every right minded
                        person, a man who is guilty of such misrepresentation of facts and
                        hyperbolical statements to the detriment of his country, as it are contained
                        in his writings, can only be pronounced an an'i nationalist. We are well
                        aware that his interest in the affairs and people of Egypt is of the
                        keenest, and on each a point we could heartily agree with him, but in making
                        it his obvious aim to sully the Damer L of Great Britain in hør dealings
                        with a country which she has spatched from the abyss of bankraptoy and
                        slavery and raised almost to t the pinnsole of prosperity be estranges that
                        lo sympatby which serions men could otherwise hold for him. There might be
                        some slight excuse were Mr. Blunt ignorant of this country and its people,
                        but he has passed a considerable It portion of twenty-five years in Egypt,
                        during which time he has seriously studied the customs of the modern
                        Egyptians, and he cannot have b failed to note the unwavering maroh of
                        progrezat that the country has made under our guidance. 1. Indeed, one is
                        driven to doubt the sincerity 1. of the land of Little Englanders whose cry
                        of "British Injustice in Egypt” is now so prominent, especially in view of
                        the fact that one of the most conspicuous of these has a full knowledge of
                        the country from personal experience. </p>
                    <p>That Mr. Blunt's latest publication will receive credence in England is
                        hardly likely, for, happily, the majority of the home Press have dealt with
                        the regrettable incident of Danishwai in that equitable spirit which is
                        still the prədominant characteristic of the Britisher, despite the attempts
                        of a small declamatory party to persuade the world of the contrary. There is
                        the danger, however, that it may, in conjunction with the impetuous orations
                        of certain members of Parliament and vehement arterioles of a few
                        journalists lead some to doubt the wisdom with which the representatives of
                        Great Britain are directing the Government of Egypt, and, though there will
                        speedily be convinced of the injaatios of such a consolation if they are to
                        study the question more deeply, a certain amount of mischief may be caused.
                        It is somewhat remarkable that Mr. Blant should play a prominent part in the
                        endeavour of a few self-styled nationalists to foment the native to the
                        verge of fanaticism, when he asserts such interest in their welfare, as he
                        must surely realise that any forcible demonstration would be to the serious
                        disadvantage of the people. The irrationality of Mr. Blunt and his fellow
                        antinationaliste, in addition to filling us with contempt, draws upon us the
                        contomely of foreign nations, who come to the not unnatural conclusion that
                        the abundance of Anglophobe Britishers is an indication of the deterioration
                        of our race. As the crow pounces with avidity upon carriou, so such men
                        seize every opportunity to belittle their fellow countrymen in the eyes of
                        other nations. England, alas, is being nauseated by an unparalleled wave of
                        anti-British hysteria, which became epidemic at the commencement of the Boer
                        war, and the sound of raucous voices pouring undeserved reproach upon men
                        who are conscientiously and successfally striving to further the interests
                        of countries which the first Power of the world has taken under her wing has
                        become sufficiently common to constitute a peril to the Empire. It is
                        deplorable that men of our own nationality endeavour to hide their utter
                        lack of patriotism and a spurious cloak of humanitarianism, and</p>
                    <p>hold up to the world as martyrs semi-barbarians who have been guilty of an
                        extraordinarily</p>
                    <p>brutal outrage. Such absolute anti-nationalism is incomprehensible, and the
                        attempt of our Little-Englanders to drive their mother-country on to the
                        rooks is worse than dastardly.</p>

                    <p>GOVERNMENT TO THE RESCUE</p>
                    <p>The prevailing scarcity of gold has today been very considerably alleviated
                        by the</p>
                    <p>prompt action of the Government in conjunction with the National Bank.
                        Certain funds</p>
                    <p>which are not available in ordinary cases have been placed as a temporary
                        measure by the</p>
                    <p>Government at the National Bank's disposal. The mere knowledge of this fact,
                        combined with the ansidance given by the Bank to the market, has changed the
                        aspect of affairs, and by financial ciroles have resumed their normal
                        activity at this season of the year.</p>
                    <p>The thanks of the financial and mercantile community are due to the Egyptian
                        Government for the ready way it took measures to meet a situation which was
                        causing serious inconvenience not only in Alexandria, but also in Cairo and
                        the interior.</p>
                    <p>It appears to be popularly believed that if a State Bank was in existence in
                        Egypt, it would be able to prevent any similar crisis owing to its large
                        reserve. But if each bank were established, it would in all probability find
                        it advantageous to keep its reserve in London just as the other banks do,
                        seeing that money can be obtained by telegram in six days. To keep a large
                        reserve permanently in Egypt would involve loss of interest during the
                        summer to a considerable extent. As was remarked yesterday, it has been
                        suggested that the Government and the Caisse de la Dette are somewhat to be
                        blamed for the existing stringency, and so much money gets looked upon its
                        receipt in payment of taxes. But it would be as well to remind our readers
                        that, in virtue of the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904, the receipts of the
                        land tax are paid in to the Caisse de la Dette, which has no power to
                        release these items, while the balance of the Government revenues are
                        sufficient at this beginning of the year to meet the outgoings in the shape
                        of ordinary expenditure. Consequently no blame for such a stringency can
                        fall on the</p>
                    <p>Government. It is, on the contrary, the banks upon whom the responsibility
                        falls in failing</p>
                    <p>to be prepared for such an extraordinary contingency by making proper
                        provision. On the other hand we do not consider that the banker can be held
                        to be so fall of foresight as to anticipate such unexampled prices at the
                        opening of the cotton season. It will be remembered that temporary crises of
                        this patare are by no means unprecedented in the commercial records of
                        Alexandria, and all such crises have been invariably alleviated in all few
                        days time by the arrival of money from London.</p>
                    <p>As the currency of Egypt is practicably in British sovereigns, it is very
                        easy to remedy any stringency by merely wiring to London. If, however, the
                        currency were partly Egyptian, it is quite possible that a most serious
                        situation would arise under similar circumstances.</p>

                        mis-read the letter I wrote to you from the Fayoum a few days ago. I was
                        then labouring under the impression that I was accusing one of your
                        correspondents of snobbishness in speaking slightingly of the benefits of a
                        Board School Education. I ventured to point out the superiority of a Board
                        School Education to that of Public School and 'Varsity, and I spok, of the
                        latter form of education as being possibly a misfortune. Will “A eore
                        Business Man" do me the favoar of reading my letter once again and more
                        carefully, and then informing me whence he infers that I consider that the
                        British Commercial Community here has enjoyed a Board School education! No
                        such insinuation was made, and moreover the benefits of a Board School
                        Education were described as superior to those of a 'Varsity and Publio
                        Bohool education. How the remarks in my letter could have been so distorted
                        as to bring about a meaning contrary to that intended is hard to imagine.
                        There seems to be considerable bitterness shown on the part of the
                        unofficial correspondents in this controversy. Let them rest assured that
                        this bitterness is in no way reciprocated, and that the greatest admiration,
                        and respect for our commercial fellow countrymen here, who do so much to
                        keep England’s name and reputation bright, are felt by all Anglo-Egyptian
                        officials, not excluding</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE ."</p>
                    <p>Sir,---The charge made against "five or six civilian officials” by your
                        correspondent "Ex. Officio" appears to me to be an argument in favor of my
                        original suggestion, that all Government officials or employés should wear
                        the tarbush as a protection against being taken for members of the
                        commercial community. Surely if the official clsdd adopted the suggestion
                        made in my letter of the 19th September and, wore some distinguishing badge
                        no such charge as that referred to above could be made against a community
                        composed of gentlemen who are mostly University scholars, and who as such, I
                        feel sure, would never disgrace themselves in the manner stated to have
                        occurred in the small hours of the morning.--I am, etc.</p>
                    <p>ANOTHER RESIDENT OF OVER 80 YEARS'S STANDING. </p>
                    <p>Cairo, October 4.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir. — The ideal condition of existence in Cairo would be a community of
                        Anglo-Egyptian officials, undisturbed by the presence of any commercial
                        people of their own race. The British commercial man is doubtless a very
                        well-meaning person in his way, but his presence introduces a certain
                        jarring note and I fully sympathise with the attitude of French</p>
                    <p>and German officialdom, who in the so-called colonies of those nations do
                        their best to</p>
                    <p>ensure a tranquil life by suppressing the commercial men of their own race by
                        making their existence intolerable. However, for good or ill, such is not
                        the policy of the British Government and at Cairo we should learn to
                        tolerate them. We need not arouse their irritation by us patronising airs
                        and should always rather adopt a condescending attitude to this class of
                        human beings, but at the same time if they consider that their racial
                        relationship to us affords them a special right to criticise, they should be
                        taught to keep to their place. The best way of treating these people is to
                        adopt an attitude of studied irony towards them. Sach treatment would
                        prevent them from becoming familiar, as it appears to puzzle them.---I am,
                        truly yours.</p>
                    <p>СANТАВ. </p>
