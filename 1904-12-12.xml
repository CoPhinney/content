            <p>Reuter's correspondent before Port Arthur describes the fighting preceding the
                capture of the 203-metre hill as being more intensely ferocious and bloody than
                anything previously th reported. Whole detachments were obliterated time after time.
                Every defence work was a block of bodies. Bayonets, clubbed rifles, and h grenades
                were constantly used. (Reuter.) C</p>

            <p>GERMANY "BULWARK OF PEACE."</p>
            <p>BERLIN, December 10.</p>
            <p>REICHSTAG-During the debate on the war budget, the Socialists opposed the increase of
                the army on the ground that Russia was crippled.</p>
            <p>They renewed their charges against the Government of partiality towards Russia in the
                present war. Count von Bülow deprecated being guided by sentimental views in
                delicate questions of international policy. Such an influence caused people to take
                a wrong road in the South African war. He asserted Germany's complete neutrality,
                and ridiculed the suggestion that there was a secret treaty be tween Russia and
                Germany. The more the Press and the Socialists attacked Russia, the more he must
                exert himself to keep the relations with Russia peaceful and friendly. It is
                impossible to ignore the fact that there exist in Europe undercurrents leading
                towards war like complications, but Germany now-as in the past is the bulwark of
                peace, though solely because of her strength. (Reuter.)</p>

            <p>Serious riots have taken place here to-day. A number of students of both sexes, who
                had gathered on the Newski Prospect, made a demonstration against the autocracy, and
                shouted for the war to cease. They were charged by the police and a struggle ensued.

            <p>CAIRO FLOWER SHOW.</p>
            <p>The Winter Horticultural Show held at Ghe zireh on Saturday and Sunday was a thorough
                Ke ad success. Bright, if somewhat windy, weather prevailed, the exhibits reached a
                very high Iss standard, and Cairo society was there in large numbers. Among those
                present we noticed Mo H.H. Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel, the Earl and Countess of
                Cromer, Abani Pasha and Iss several of the Ministers, the Italian Minister and
                Marchesa Salvago-Raggi, M. Maximoff, M. Maskens, the Hon. F. H. Morgan and Sai Miss
                Morgan, M. Lecomte, Mr. P. Machell, Yacoub Pasha Artin, Mr. Courtenay Clifton and
                Mrs. Clifton, Dr. and Mrs. Keatinge, Mil- hem Bey Chakour and Miss Chakour, M. and
                Mme. George Nangovich Bey, Dr. Harold Im e, Nolan and Mrs. Nolan, Dr. and Mrs.
                Symmers, Dr. and Mrs. Elliot-Smith, Mr. Carton del ots Wiart, Dr. and Mrs.
                Mackenzie, Mr. A. J. Cotterill and Mrs. Cotterill, and many others. Iss The roses
                were a great feature of the show. For two years in succession there had been no
                exhibit of roses owing to the want of sufficient ld competitors, and the fine show
                of flowers, in many of them exquisitely beautiful in form ish and colour, was very
                gratifying after previous ice failures. The early vegetables also deserve Is
                d-special notice. Special encouragement had been se given to nurserymen to produce
                early vege e. tables for the market, and the results were shexceptionally good. The
                palms and decorative on plants in the central hall lent by Prince Hus as sein Pasha
                Kamel added greatly to the beauty of the exhibition, and we must not forget the I
                beautiful cut roses exhibited by the President of the K.A.S. but not competing.</p>

            <p>A Rugby football match between "Cairo" and ve "The Provinces" was played on Saturday
                last th at Ghezireh, and provided a great deal of athusement to onlookers, though we
                fancy that se the players found the ground unpleasantly hard. Cairo led at half-time
                by 2tries to 1, and A afterwards, aided by the fact that one of the W opposing
                half-backs, who had scored after a fine run, was "crooked," they won comfortably. an
                The Provinces were handicapped by the lu difficulty of raising a full team, some of

                the Arab schools had much improved since last match, mainly due to continued

                for an interview with the Khedive's brother, on hearing of his having is
                accomplished a long and interesting trip Sud h through several countries of the
                Continent during his recent visit to Europe, the Prince most kindly accorded me this
                honour and I called on his Highness a few days ago." The Prince, who speaks French
                and English fluently. st, was most gracious, and seated in the beauti ful garden of
                his palace, situated opposite the Savoy Hotel, I passed a very agreeable hour whilst
                his Highness gave me an account of h. his excursion.</p><p>"Accompanied by my
                private secretary and two European friends," began the Prince, "we, left Paris one
                lovely morning in July in a motor ear of the same type and make as that of the
                Empress Eugenie, on our way to Geneva, travelling at an easy pace and stopping at
                al, several places between the two cities. We stopped three days at Geneva, and the
                time was pleasantly spent in taking drives in, the beautiful neighbourhood of that
                delightful place, including an ascent of Mont Salèves, buried in eternal
                snows.</p><p>"From Geneva we proceeded to Chamounix T. and thence to Thonon, on Lake
                Leman, and passing Evicius-les-Bains, a favorite resort of or the Khedive, we went
                on to Bex. Here of again we made another three days stay and The during that time we
                drove to Viege (or Visp) her an old world village 2,160 feet above sea level her and
                picturesquely placed at the mouth of the Visp Valley. From Bex we retraced our steps
                to Aigle, another summer resort in the Ormont Valley, near the Rhane of lake of
                Geneva. At Aigle, I may say, commenced the win most beautiful part of the whole of
                our trip over the fine mountain road,and amidst magnificent day scenery we passed on
                to Château D'Oex,a quiet ina pastoral straggling village of between 2,000 TOW and
                3,000 inhabitants. From this enchanting spot we proceeded over the Zwey Saanen pass
                to Interlaken, leaving the railway at Zwey- rom zimmen and passing several very
                pretty vil lages on our way to Lakes Thum and Brienz between which Interlaken lies.
                Our party made up its mind to stop here for 15 days,and spend the fortnight in
                making daily excursions over all the mountain districts in the vicinity. Of all the
                ascents we made during our, entire trip the most difficult was that to St.
                Beatenberg, the turnings being very sharp and the road and very narrow for so big a
                motor as ours was. last This small place, perched high up amongst of the mountains,
                nearly 4,000 feet above the hat sea, is a fairy like spot and favorite Alpine atly
                health resort on the north side of Lake Thum. and After visiting every part of the
                neighbourhood the we went to Lucerne, over the Brunnen Pass. P We rattled through
                Lucerne without stopping, and went on to a neighbouring village for luncheon and
                thence on to Brunnen, at the other end of the lake, by the lovely road or the
                Achsentrasse. Breaking our trip at Brun-le nen we made trips as far as Göschenen, on
                the T great St. Gothard Pass, and returning to o Brunnen we proceeded past Lake
                Schwytz to Zurich, putting up for five days at Dodler's d Hotel, on the hills near
                that town. From n ment Zurich we journeyed to Schaffhausen to see the illumination
                of the famous Falls of the Rhine w by Bengal lights. After two days spent here o we
                proceeded through Aaran to Basle and from the latter town across the frontier to
                Nancy f where we lunched. After resting we went on to o the Belgian frontier, where
                we arrived at 2.30 ting in the afternoon and had a most amusing con- tretemps, on
                account of the Custom House oyle being closed until 3 o'clock. We had to go back
                iced to Sedan to get gold money, notes being refused, in order to pay duty on the
                automobile, amounting to 2,300 francs. I should here add that I have not yet had
                this sum refunded and am writing to Mesers, Cook about it. A most amusing incident
                occurred between Nancy and wling the Belgian frontier. It was at night, and we were
                going at a very moderate pace, when suddenly two brilliant lights appeared in front
                of us and right in the middle of the road. We kets stopped at once, not knowing
                where the lights came from. Thieves there could not be surely so close to the two
                frontiers, but then where</p><p>1 did the lights come from 1 Slowly they approached
                and presently we heard a stern voice shout out Qui na la. We answered Amis,
                whereupon two gendarmes, armed to the teeth, galloped up and asked for our passports
                After carefully examining these and our motor car they allowed us to go on with a
                friendly "Bon soir Messieurs."</p><p>"From the frontier, we drove straight on to
                Brussels and after a two days' stay at the 0 Hotel Bellevue in that city, during
                which we paid a visit to Antwerp, we left Brussels for Paris, the whole trip
                occupying just one month ickets and a half. The weather, fortunately for
                us,</p><p>1</p><p>was very fine all the time. I drove the whole 6 six weeks myself.
                Before leaving I should like 1 you to say, for the benefit of others who may 0 wish
                to make the same delightful excursion, that in Switzerland the roads were mostly
                bad, the stones being simply placed on the ground for the wheeled traffic to do the
                rest of the ckets work, instead of the steam roller, In Belgium, again, the roads
                are also bad and the streets of most towns so badly paved that it is very
                disagreeable and almost impossible to drive at any speed. The best roads are
                undoubtedly those in Alsace and in France, but I should mer, add that,
                notwithstanding the execrable roads in some parts, we never had one breakdown, which
                proves the excellence of the French-build CAIRO Automobile."</p><p>And here the
                courteous Prince rose and, ying he had another visitor waiting to see LD. him,
                wished me good morning, as he heartily shook my hand,</p></note>

                would never be allow ed, but peace and the prosperity of its subjects were the true
                aims and objects of the Sudan Government He warned all against the result of
                disloyalty and exhorted then to support the Government and labor for its and their
                own prosperity.</p>
            <p>After the conelusion of this address, with which all present seemed much impressed,
                re- wards and presents were distributed to those who had assisted the
                Government.</p>
            <p>His Excellency personally inspected the rubber plant, the development of which is now
                awaiting reports of experts. His Excelleney was particularly struck with the fine
                work and great difficulties overcome by the sudd-cutting parties on the Jur, and has
                ordered the explo ration of other important but sudd Blocked tributaries of the
                Bahr-el-Ghazal. The Jur river has been found navigable about 70 miles south of Wau
                for probably six months of the</p>
            <p>year.</p>
            <p>Letters were dispatched to the Niam Niam Sultan Timbouro and N'Dorums regretting the
                Sirdar's inability to await their arrival, thanking them for the help they had given
                the Government, and expressing the hope that the Niam Niam nation would learn to
                respect and recognise Government authority, and obtain the ad- vantages of peace and
                settled rule."</p>
            <p>Leaving Wau at 5 am. on the 19th Novem ber, the Sirdar proceeded to Meshra él-Rek and
                inspected Tewtikieh, Obok, Melút, Renk, Ka wa, and Duem, arriving at Khartoum 1 p.m.
