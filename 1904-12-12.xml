                <p> The Baltic Fleet </p>
                <p>A telegram from Djibouti this morning announces that Admiral Foelkersahm's
                    squadron is preparing to leave that port in order to join the other portion of
                    the fleet at Madagascar. Now it is worthy of notice that Admiral Rojestvensky's
                    last "jumping-off" place for the Far East, after his trying journey round the
                    cape, will be Madagascar, which, be it noted, is a French Possession. It is to
                    be sincerely hoped, for the sake of the peace of Europe, that the French
                    Govern,ent will not fail to observe the laws of neutrality most strictly at this
                    point, and that they wull not permit Antongil bay to be used by the Russian
                    Fleet for the puspose of coaling or refitting. Otherwise there is likely to be
                    trouble. Before very long matters are likely to become somewhat lively dwn
                    Singapore way. It is probable that Togo will as soon as possible send his
                    destroyres down to the Strait of Malacca, and the Strait of Sunda, his cruisers
                    following; and his battleships to another rendevous. At the same time, a
                    sufficient numner will be retained up north for watching Vladi vostok. Togo is
                    certain also to pay particular attention to any colliers attending the fleet,
                    and to use as far as possible his enemy's supply of fuel. In this connection it
                    must be remembered that the coal capacity of the Russian battleships is a large
                    one, and they are not likely to let their colliers run the risk of passing
                    through the Straits with them, the last coaling being carried out west of
                    Sumatra and south of Batavia. Whether Rodjestvensky intends to join up his
                    forces or to disperse them it is imporrible, as yet, to foresee; and indeed, the
                    choice of action will not rest entirely in the hands of the Russian Admiral. It
                    is hardly likely that the division passing round Africa 
            <cb n="4"/>
           will fail to pass through the Strait of Sunda, as 2 more easterly passage would
                    bring his ships into the dangerous and only partially-surveyed waters of the
                    Malay Archipelago; on the other hand the passage of his ships through the narrow
                    neck of water between Sumatra and Java will enable Togo to locate him exactly
                    and deal with him accordingly; and a similar state of things, though not in
                    quite such &amp; confined degree, will exist in the Strait of Malacca.</p>

        <p>LONDON, December 10. The Admiralty announce an important reorganisation in the Navy with
            the object of remedying certain defects of mobilisation. The Home Fleet will in future
            be called the Channel Fleet. It is to become the senior command in the Navy, and will
            consist of 12 battleships, with a proportionate number of cruisers. The I present
            Channel Fleet is in future to be known as the Atlantic Fleet, with a base at
            Gibraltar.</p>
        <p>It will consist of eight battleships, and a pro| portionate number of cruisers. The other
            squadrons are to be divided into three groups; the Eastern consisting of China,
            Australia, and the East Indies; the Western consisting of North America, and the West
            Indies; the third group will be the Cape Fleet, forming a connecting link with the
            others. There are to be three cruiser squadrons—one each in the Channel, Atlantic, and
            Mediterranean-detachable for special cruises.</p>
        <p>Henceforth the entire Reserve Fleet will remain constantly commissioned and ready for
            immediate service. It will exercise -at sea periodically. There will be maneuvers in
            1905 and 1906 for the navy throughout the world. It will be assumed that war has broken
            out, and that all the reserves are mobilising and proceeding under their Rear-Admirals
            to rein. force the fleets to which they are affiliated. l'he flag-officers everywhere
            will have to act on their own initiative in arranging for mutual co-operation.
            References to the Admiralty will be forbidden.</p>
        <p>(Reuter.)</p>
        <p>LONDON, December 11. The Admiralty has circularised to the commanding officers explaining
            the changes, which will come into force on the 1st January. The fleet will be divided in
            time of peace into a fleet in commission at sea, and a fleet in commission in reserve.
            As all commissions are for two years and a half, the fleet in commission at sea will be
            relieved annually. Twelve battleships and cruisers, kept in home ports, will be
            commissioned in case of emergencies, indepen. dent of the general mobilisation.

                    <p> Berlin, December 10</p>
                    <p>REICHSTAG- During the debate on the war budget, the Socialists opposed the
                        increase of the army on the ground that Russia was crippled.</p>
                    <p>They renewed their charged against the government of partiality towards
                        Russia in the present war. Count von Bulow deprecated being guided by
                        sentimental views in delicate questions of international policy. Such an
                        incluence caused people to take a wrong-road in the South African war. He
                        asserted Germany's complete neutrality, and ridiculed the suggestion that
                        there was a secret treaty between Russia and Germany. The more the Press and
                        the Socialists attacked Russia, the more he must exert himself to keep the
                        relations with Russia peaceful and friendly. It is impossible to ignore the
                        fact that there exist in Europe undercurrents leading towards warlike
                        complications, but Germany now- as in the past-is the bulwark of peace,
                        though solely because of her strength (<hi rend="italic">reuter). </hi></p>

                    <p> ST. PETERSBERG, DECEMBER 11. </p>
                    <p>Serious riots have taken place here to-day. A number of students of both
                        sexes, who had gathered on the NEwski Project, made a demonstration against
                        the autocracy, and shouted for the war to cease. They were charged by the
                        police and a struggle ensued. Many students were wounded and others
                        arrested. (<hi rend="italic">Reuter). </hi></p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBERG, DECEMBER 11</p>
                    <p>The students made a manifestation on the Newski Project against the autocracy
                        and the war. The police scattered them and arrested a large number. Fifty
                        were wounded. <hi rend="italic">(H).</hi></p>

                    <head> ENGLAND IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p> The eleventh edition of Lord Milner's "England in Egypt" has just appeared.
                        The novel feature of this edition is Sir Eldon Gorst's sketch of the latest
                        stage in Egyptian progress, which bring the history of England in absolutely
                        up to date, and is entitled "Egypt in 1904." The qualifications of Sir Eldon
                        for such a task are exceptional, and this interesting addition to this
                        Baedeker to political Egypt will be found in every respect worthy of the pen
                        of the late Financial Adviser to the Khedive. The general merits of the work
                        are too well known in this country to need any commendation from us, and the
                        apprencides of Sir Clinton Dawkins and Sir Eldon Gorst bring it as far as
                        the present year. No inhabitant of Wgypt who takes an intellectual interest
                        in its affairs, and has an acquaintance with our language, should neglect to
                        procure this work, which is published in a conveinently handy form and at a
                        moderate price. </p>

                    <head> CAIRO FLOWER SHOW</head>
                    <p> The WInter Horticultural Show held at Ghezirch on Staurday and Sunday was a
                        thorough success. Bright, if somewhat windy, weather prevailed, the exhibits
                        reached a very high standard, and Cairo society was there in large numbers.
                        Among those present we noticed H.H. Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel, the Earl and
                        Countess of Cromer, Abani Pasha and several of the ministers, the Italian
                        Minister and Marchessa Salvago-Raggi, M. Maximoff, M. Maskens, the Hon F.H.
                        Morgan and Miss Morgan, M. Lecomte, Mr. P. Machell, Yacoub Pasha Artin, Mr.
                        Courtenay Clifton and Mrs. Clifton, Dr. and Mrs. Keatinge, Milhem Bey
                        Chakour and Miss Chakour, M. and Mme. George Nungovich Bey, Dr. Harold Nolan
                        and Mrs. Nolan, Dr. and Mrs. Symmers, Dr. and Mrs.. Elliot-Smith, Mr. Carton
                        del Wiart, Dr. and Mrs. Mackenzie, Mr. A.J. Cotterill and Mrs. Cotterill,
                        and many others.</p>
                    <p> The roses were a great feature of the shpw. For two years in succession
                        there had been no exhibit of roses owing to the want of suffiicient
                        competitirs, and the fine show of flowers, many of them exquisitely
                        becutiful in form and colour, was very gratifying after previous failures.
                        The vegetables also deserve special notice. SPecial encouragement had been
                        given to nurserymen to produce early vegetables for the market, and the
                        results were exceptionally good. The palms and decorative plants in the
                        central hall lent by Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel added greatly to the beauty
                        of the exhibition, and we much not forget the beautiful cut roses exhibited
                        by the President of the K.A.S. but not competing. </p>

                                provided a great deal of Amusement to onlookers, though we fancy
                                that| the players found the ground unpleasantly hard. Cairo led at
                                half-time by 2 tries to 1, and afterwards, aided by the fact that
                                one of the opposing half-backs, who had scored after a fine run, was
                                "crocked,” they won comfortably. The Provinces were handicapped by
                                the difficulty of raising a full team, some of their best players
                                being called away from Cairo on Saturday morning.</p>

                        <p>Having asked for an interview with the Khedive's brother, on hearing of
                            his having accomplished a long and interesting trip through several
                            countries of the Continent during his recent visit to Europe, the Prince
                            most kindly accorded me this 'honour and I called on his Highness a few
                            days ago. The Prince, who speaks French and English fluently, was most
                            gracious, and seated in the beauti ful garden of his palace, situated
                            opposite the Savoy Hotel, I passed a very agreeable hour whilst his
                            Highness gave me an account of his excursion.</p>
                        <p>"Accompanied by my private secretary and two European friends," began the
                            Prince, "we left Paris one lovely morning in July in a motor car of the
                            same type and make as that of the Empress Eugenie, on our way to Geneva,
                            travelling at an easy pace and stopping at several places between the
                            two cities. We stopped three days at Geneva, and the time was pleasantly
                            spent in taking drives in the beautiful neighbourhood of that delightful
                            place, including an •Ascent of Mont Salèves, buried in eternal
                            snows.</p>
                        <p>"From Geneva we proceeded to Chamounix and thence to 'Thonon, on Lake
                            Leman, and passing Evicius-les-Bains, &amp; favorite resort of the
                            Khedive, we went on to Bex. Here again we made another three days' stay
                            and during that time we drove to Viege (or Visp) an old world village
                            2,160 feet above sea level and picturesquely placed at the mouth of the
                            Visp Valley. From Bex we retraced our steps to Aigle, another summer
                            resort in the Ormont Valley, near the Rhane of lake of Geneva. At Aigle,
                            I may say, commenced the most beautiful part of the whole of our trip
                            over the fine mountain road and amidst magnificent scenery we passed on
                            to Château D'Oex,&amp; quiet pastoral straggling village of between
                            2,000 and 3,000 inhabitants. From this enchanting spot we proceeded over
                            the Zwey Saanen pags to Interlaken, leaving the railway at Zweyzimmen
                            and passing several very pretty vil. | lages on our way to Lakes Thum
                            and Brienz between which Interlaken lies. Our party made up its mind to
                            stop here for 15 days,and spend the fortnight in making daily excursions
                            over all the mountain districts in the vicinity. Of all the ascents we
                            made during our entire trip the most difficult was that to St.
                            Beatenberg, the turnings being very sharp and the road very narrow for
                            so big a motor as ours was. This small place, perched high up amongst
                            the mountains, nearly 4,000 feet above the sea, is a fairy-like spot and
                            favorite Alpine health resort on the north side of Lake Thum. | After
                            visiting every part of the neighbourhood we went to Lucerne, over the
                            Brunnen Pags. We rattled through Lucerne without stopping, and went on
                            to a neighbouring village for luncheon and thence on to Brunnen, at the
                            other end of the lake, by the lovely road or the Achsentrasse. Breaking
                            our trip at Brunnen we made trips as far as Göschenen, on the great St.
                            Gothard Pass, and returning to Brunnen we proceeded past Lake Schwytz to
                            Zurich, putting up for five days at Dodler's Hotel, on the hills near
                            that town. From Zurich we journeyed to Schaffhausen to see the
                            illumination of the famous Falls of the Rhine by Bengal lights. After
                            two days spent here we proceeded through Aaran to Basle and from the
                            latter town across the frontier to Nancy where we lunched. After resting
                            we went on to</p>
                        <p>the Belgian frontier, where we arrived at 2,30 | in the afternoon and had
                            a most amusing con</p>
                        <p>tretemps, on account of the Custom House | being closed until 3 o'clock.
                            We had to go back to Sedan to get gold money, notes being refused, in
                            order to pay duty on the automobile, amounting to 2,300 francs. I should
                            here add that I have not yet had this sum refunded and | am writing to
                            Messrs, Cook about it. A most</p>
                        <p>amusing incident occurred between Nancy and | the Belgian frontier. It
                            was at night, and we were going at a very moderate pace, when suddenly
                            two brilliant lights appeared in front of us and right in the middle of
                            the road. We stopped at once, not knowing where the lights came from.
                            Thieves there could not be surely so close to the two frontiers, but
                            then where did the lights come from 1 Slowly they approached and
                            presently we heard a stern voice shout out Qui va la. We answered |
                            Amis, whereupon two gendarmes, armed to the teeth, galloped up, and
                            asked for our passports. After carefully examining these and our motor
                            car they allowed us to go on with a friendly "Bon soir Messieurs." |
                            "From the frontier we drove straight on to | Brussels and after a two
                            days' stay at the</p>
                        <p>Hotel Bellevue in that city, during which we I paid a visit to Antwerp,
                            we left Brussels for | Paris, the whole trip occupying just one month
                            and a half. The weather, fortunately for us, was very fine all the time.
                            I drove the whole six weeks myself. Before leaving I should like you to
                            say, for the benefit of others who may wish to make the same delightful

                            is very disagreeable and almost impossible to drive at any speed. The
                            best roads are undoubtedly those in Alsace and in France, but I should
                            add that, notwithstanding the execrable roads Tin some parts, we never

                        <head>THE BAHR-EL-GHAZAL. INSPECTION BY SIRDAR. </head>
                        <p> The Governor-General and staff left Khartoum on November 7 to inspect
                            the headquarters of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province, with the intermediate
                            stations and the Upper Nile provinces. This is believed to be the first
                            occasion on which a Governor-General of the Sudan has penetrated into
                            the heart of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province. His Excellency spent two days
                            at Wau, inspecting the station, troops, hospital, etc. </p>
                        <p>On November 18 he held a levée at which were present all the officers and
                            officials, the Roman Catholic missionary, and the principal sheikhs ;
                            among them Nasser Angil, of T'el Goma, and Moussa Ahmed Sultan, of
                            Farog, and Sultan Chak Chak, an important Dinka chief from Dar Jandė.
                            The Niam Niam Sultan Timboura, unfortunately, did not arrive in time for
                            the reception. His Excellency made a speech explaining at length the
                            aims and policy of the new Government. Slave-raiding and seizure of
                            corps, etc., would never be allowed, but peace and the prosperity of its
                            subjects were the true aims and objects of the Sudan Government. He
                            warned all against the result of disloyalty and exhorted them to support
                            the Government and labor for its and their own prosperity. </p>
                        <p>After the conclusion of this address, with which all present seemed much
                            impressed, rewards and presents were distributed to those who had
                            assisted the Government.</p>
                        <p> His Excellency personally inspected the rubber plant, the development of
                            which is now awaiting reports of experts. His Excellency was
                            particularly struck with the fine work and great difficulties overcome
                            by the sudd-cutting parties on the Jur, and has ordered the exploration
                            of other important but sudd-Blocked tributaries of the Bahr-el-Ghazal.
                            The Jur river has been found navigable about 70 miles south of Wau for
                            probably six months of the year.</p>
                        <p> Letters were dispatched to the Niam Niam Sultan Timbouro and N'Doruma
                            regretting the Sirdar's inability to await their arrival, thanking them
                            for the help they had given the Government, and expressing the hope that
                            the Niam Niam nation would learn to respect and recognise Government
                            authority, and obtain the advantages of peace and settled rule. </p>
                        <p>Leaving Wau at 5 a.m. on the 19th November, the Sirdar proceeded to
                            Meshra el-Rek and inspected Tewfikieh, Obok, Melut, Renk, Kawa, and
                            Duem, arriving at Khartoum 1 p.m. November 27. </p>
