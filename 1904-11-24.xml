                <div type="section"><head>STREET NOMENCLATURE.</head>
                <p>Some months ago the Post Office Administration notified the public that in future
                        correspondents should, in addressing their letters, never fail to give the
                        name of the street and the number of the house where the addressee resided.
                        The penalty for failing to comply with this regulation was delay in the
                        delivery of the letters imperfectly addressed. It was pointed out in our
                        columns at the time that many streets in Cairo were utterly unbaptizes,
                        while more often than not the Public Works Administration appeared to regard
                        the affixing of numbers to houses as one of the superfluities of
                        civilization. After the Post Office Administration had issued the notice in
                        question, some attempts were made by the Public Works Department to name a
                        few streets in Cario, but it appears that the efforts have been relaxed for
                        there are many streets in the Capital which are innocent of any designation
                        whatsoever. We may instance three or four streets running off the
                        Kasr-el-Ainy-road, on the left as one goes towards the hospital from
                        Kasr-el-Nil Bridge. These streets are nameless, and therefore the regulation
                        of the Post office cannot be complied with. It has been maliciously rumoured
                        that the reason why so many streets are unnamed is because of the jealousy
                        among officials, who cannot come to any agreement among themselves and to
                        which of them shall be immortalized by christening the streets with their
                        own names. This is ridiculous, for the modesty of our official classes is
                        proverbial. But we fail to see any reason why the names of prominent
                        Anglo-Egyptians should not figure on the street as well as those of native
                        notables, such as Idris Bey Ragheb, whose name adorns a street near El
                        Daher, and also in other cases. At Alexandria we have streets named after
                        Goussio, Adib, Antonisdis, Gordon, Mariette, and numerous other local
                        notabilties. Surely there are plenty of officials belonging to the Public
                        Works Department or the Ministries of Justice and the Interior whose names
                        would be useful for these streets ! Such names as Garstin, Dunlop, or
                        McIlwraith might fittingly be adapted to street nomenclature. As the roads
                        we have mentioned are in the neighbourhood of the new schools by the
                        Kasr-el-Ainy-road it would be appropriate to use some of the names of the
                        high officials in the Ministry of Public Instruction, such as that of Dr.
                        Dunlop, Yacoub Pasha Artin, etc. The opportunities  thus afforded for
                        immortalizing many names whose owners are closely connected with the
                        development of modern Egypt would be unllimited, as new streets are
                        springing up daily. Another plan, in case of disagreement, would be to put
                        the matter up to an auction, as there must be many who would be only too
                        eager to see their names inscribed on the walls of Cairo for all time. The
                        sum realised should be of great utility in swelling the revenues of the
                        Tanzim Department, which pleads poverty as an excuse for neglecting its
                        duties towards the public.</p>

                    <p>The Canal will be cleared of all traffic during the passage of the fleet.</p>

                    <p>The Russian Squadron, coming from Suda Bay, is in sight. The ships are
                        entering one after the other. It is believed they will remain a few hours in
                        the port. Every precaution has be taken for their passage through the Canal.
                        The Greek Squadron left yesterday for Syra.</p>

                    <p>Port Said, Thursday, 11.46 a.m.</p>
                    <p>At 2 o'clock this morning the Russian Consul-Gerneral, M. Maximoff, and some
                        pilots left the port to meet the fleet on its way here.</p>
                    <p>At 4 o'clock four of the Russian destroyers arrived and anchored in the outer
                        harbour. Four warships and eight store ships arrived later. The store ships
                        anchored while the warships kept on the move. </p>
                    <p>At daylight the rest of the flet entered the harbour, and there was nearly a
                        collision.</p>
                    <p>The ships in the harbour were not allowed to leave while the fleet was
                        entering.</p>
                    <p>The colliers carry Cardiff coal loaded in Sebastopol. There are naval crews
                        on all the store ships. The officers are reported to be smart, while the
                        crews are very inefficient.</p></div>
                <div type="section"><head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGPYTIAN GAZETTE.</head>
                <p>Sir,-Referring to the Port Said Notes in your issue of yesterday's date, might I
                        suggest that as a measure of precaution the authorities be requested to
                        suspend the firing of the Ramadam gun at Port Said, Ismalia and Suez during
                        the passage of the Baltic Fleet through the Suez Canal. In their present
                        chronic state of nervousness, there is no knowing what the famous Fleet may
                        be capable of doing, if they are startled by the firing of the gun.</p>
                    <p>I am, etc., </p>
                    <p>SHICK YOUSIF.</p></div>
                <div type="section"><head>Cairo, November 23.</head>
                <p>Says the Pall Mall Gazette:-The Suez Canal is to be padded with cotton wool for
                        the passage of the "Second Pacific Squadron." That is to say, not only will
                        there be special protection of the banks and a suspension of all northward
                        traffic to give the warships an uninterrupted passage, but the captains of
                        all ships are to receive strict orders to refrain from throwing anything
                        into the Canal until the ships are through, and to prevent any kind of
                        demonstration. These precautions are most commendable. The nerves of the
                        North Sea heroes must be thought of. It is terrible to thimk of what might
                        happen if any British mercantile seamen were thoughtless enough to tap out
                        his pipe overboard within sight of a fleet that might misinterpret his
                        action, to say nothing of throwing over ashes or banana-skins. The rule
                        against demonstrations is likewise to the good. A misconcieved wink or
                        simle, seen through a Russian telescope, might produce the direst
                        complications. We have to remember that when such a fleet as this becomes
                        neurotic it is others who suffer.</p></div>

            <div type="section"><head>SUDDEN DEATH ON BOURSE.</head>
            <p>SENSATION IN CITY.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Augustine Salvago, a broker belonging to the firm of Cumbo, Maximoff
                        &amp; Co., on the Alexandria Bourse, died under tragic circumstances this
                        morning. At about half-past ten o'clock, he was sitting in the cafe of the
                        Bourse taking a cup of coffee, when he was siezed with a heart failure and
                        died on the spot.</p>
                    <p>A few minutes before he had received a telegram concerning his business and
                        sat down awaiting a confirmatory wire. While seated he was joined by a
                        friend, who addressed him with a salutation several times but received no
                        reply, as Mr.Salvago had already lost the power of articulation. Seeing that
                        Mr.Salvago was seriously ill, he called for a waiter, who fetched Dr. Lian,
                        the latter happening to be on the Bourse. Dr. Lian was afterwards joined by
                        another medical man, and both did everything called for by the
                        circumstances, but unavailingly. Mr. Salvago was removed to a bench in the
                        Bourse, where he died a few minutes afterwards, without having again spoken.
                        His body was subsequently removed to his residence.</p>
                    <p>Deceased, who was about 50 years of age, leaves a widow and three children,
                        two of  whom are girls.</p>
                    <p>The occurrence caused a great sensation in the city, and crowds gathered in
                        the immediate neigbourhood of the Bourse. Business was suspended for fifteen
                        minutes as a sign of  respect.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Salvago had breathed his last a disgraceful scence occurred in the
                        cafe, where the corpse lay. Crowds of eager sightseers jostled one another
                        in their desire to view the body. The coffee tables and chairs were used as
                        points of vantage, and the crowding was terrible. No serious attempt was
                        made to deal with the crowd.</p></div>

                <p>The death of  Bewley Bey in England yesterday, announced in a private telegram
                        received by us this morning, has been expected for some time as he was in
                        failing health for many months and was suffering from an incurable malady,
                        viz., spinal paralysis. Lately he had completely lost his reason, which
                        necessitated his being put under restraint and confined in a private
                        home.</p>
                    <p>Bewley Bey, who was related to the late Captain Beyts of Suez, came out
                        originally to Europe about 30 years ago and was employed for a short time in
                        the firm of Beytz &amp; Co. of that town. He subsequently joined the
                        ill-fated expedition that was sent to Suakin shortly after under Baker
                        Pasha, and on the almost completeannihilation of that force that followed,
                        he was appointed to the police service. He was afterwards named director of
                        the Public Security Department at the Ministry of the Interior, succeeding
                        Colonel Kelly Bey, on the latter's retirement about three years ago, to the
                        important post of director of the Police Stores Department at Boulac on a
                        salary of L.E. 900 per annum. </p>
                    <p>Bewley Bey, who left Cairo last summer on sick leave, leaves a widow and
                        several children, for whom the deepest sympathy is felt by the whole British
                        community of the Capital.</p>
                    <p>Deceased was in posession of the Egyptian Medal and Bronze Star, as well as

                    <p>The lock at Santa will be completely closed to navigation and the Bagouria
                        Canal will be quite impassable; therefore, through navigation from

                        Rigoletto was given. The theatre vas crowded, and the artistes were
                        frantically applauded. Foremost amongst them we may mention  Mme Aida
                        Gonzaga, who, in the role of Gilda, displayed the full force of her talent
                        as a singer and comedienne. The barytone Arrighetti was perfect in the two
                        first acts, but appeared tired towards the end. The tenor Apostolu was
                        splendid from beginning to end. He had to repeat "Donna e mobile" in the 4th
                        act. The orchestra played admirable throughout the piece.</p></div>
