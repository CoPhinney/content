                    Egypt has recently enjoyed a happy immunity from sectarian strife ; and the days
                    when El Hakim persecuted the Copts or when Cyril and his monks butchered Hypatia
                    have left no shadow, and in their social and commercial intercourse the
                    inhabitants of the chief cities of Egypt can teach a lesson to those north Irish
                    towns where Protestant and Catholic quarrel for 364 days of the year and engage
                    in sanguinary encounter on July 14, or to English villages where "chapel-goers"
                    discover to their cost that it is ill to court the disapproval of the quality.
                    May Egypt remain untroubled by the scourge of religious dissension, for in our
                    cosmopolitan population of Moslems, Copts, Greeks, Hebrews, Roman Catholics, and
                    Protestants every element of dissension exists though religious strife is
                    happily rare. For this the caution of the Egyptian Government, the tolerance of
                    the leaders of most of the religions and nationalities here represented, and -
                    we venture to say-the great prosperity of Egypt, are responsible. Injudicious
                    State interference, intolerance on the part of the heads of sects, and
                    poverty—the three chief factors of religious strife—are happily absent.</p>
                <p>A second and equally important utterance of Lord Cromer refers to the necessity
                    for combination and co-operation between Earopeans and natives and between the
                    Earopeans of various nationalities who form so important and progressive an
                    element in the life of Egypt. We do not wish to recall painful memories of past
                    controversies and disputes-enough that the growing cordiality between the
                    various nationalities represented in Egypt is a happy omen of the country's
                    future. When Frencnmen, Britons, Greeks, Italians, and Germans show that they
                    have the good of their adopted country at heart, and aim at something wider than
                    the mere narrow interest of a small community, one of the great obstacles to
                    progress disappears. Rancour and jealousy have in the past blinded the Europeans
                    of Egypt to the fact that they must sink their differences if they are to carry
                    to a successful conclusion the task of Western civilisation in the Nile Valley,
                    a task unskillfully begun in the early years of last century by an energetic
                    European and Moslem ruler, ineffectively carried on by some of his successors,
                    now hampered by reaction, now by poverty, but never wholly abandoned and now at
                    last blessed with promise. Mutual jealousies retard, matual friendsbips promote
                    the prosperity of Egypt, and if some of us find the ideal too narrow let them
                    remember that wherever men of different nationalities and faiths live and work
                    in harmony for honourable ends, something, however trifling it may seem, has
                    been done for the furtherance of the ideal of the federation of the civilised
                    world.</p>

                <head>ISMET BEY'S DEATH.</head>
                <p>With the death of Ismet Bey, the foster-brother of the Sultan, there is
                    associated some element of an Arabian Night's story. That an official embargo of
                    a benevolent kind should be laid upon the dead man's papers was a matter of
                    course, Oriental Court intrigues and suspicions being what they are, but it is
                    stated that discoveries were made among the documents which eliminated all the
                    benevolence from official proceedings, and it is, perhaps, as well for the Bey
                    that he is "outside the jurisdiction." But, besides the documents, there were
                    found coffers stuffed with bank notes and with the securities that constituted
                    in the aggregate a veritable cave of Ali Baba. This wealth has been removed to
                    Yildiz Kiosk - ostensibly to protect the interests of the Bey's children.</p>

                <p>FLIGHT FROM THE HAREM.</p>
                <p>Reports from Constantinople state that a perfect epidemic of flights from the
                    harem seems to have broken out there, especially among Turkish women of the
                    upper classes. It will be remembered that a few months ago the two daughters of
                    the general secretary of the Foreign Office ran away to Paris. Soon afterwards
                    the daughter of the murdered Redvan Pasha aIso fled. Now comes news of the
                    flight of the daughter of the Minister of the Interior. Many prominent families
                    see that their daughters will no longer tolerate existence in a harem. Old Turks
                    who remember the Crimean War declare that since then there has never been so
                    many attempted escapes from the harem as at the present time. Then the fair
                    Turks fell in love with French officers and ran after them to Paris.</p>

                            required for the part but, her acting was extremely good and she was
                            well supported by a melodious Don José. Sig. Arrighetti, as Escamillo,
                            was rather disappointing. The choras acted well but its singing was very
                            uneven, 80 mach so as to give the impression of inadequate rehearsals.

                    <head>AN EXCITING SCENE.</head>
                    <p>A Frenchman, living in Ciccolani-street, Alexandria, has recently been
                        somewhat strange in his head. Lately he tried to set fire to his house with
                        petroleum. The landlord and neighbours became alarmed and begged the
                        consular and police authorities to secure the madman and expel him from the
                        house. Yesterday afternoon a delegate of the French Consulate, accompanied
                        by a janissary, went to the house, and a scene of great excitement ensued.
                        The madman with &amp; loaded revolver threatened to kill the delegate and
                        the janissary if they dared to set foot in his house. The local police came
                        to their aid but up to 6.30 o'clock yesterday evening nothing could be
                        effected. The man barricaded himself in and refused to budge, meantime
                        keeping his foes at bay by pointing the nozzle of his revolver through the
                        door. At 7 o'clock &amp; dozen firemen were summoned with the steam fire
                        engine and a reinforcement of twenty police. Some firemon clambered op the
                        house while others smashed the door in with their hatchets. The madman was
                        finally secured from behind and taken to the French Consulate. These
                        proceedings, which lasted from 1 to 8 p.m., aroused extraordinary excitement
                        in the neighbourhood and a crowd of some thousands of persone watched the
                        siege of the Alexandrian Fort Chabrol with the keenest interest. The
                        consular authorities have sealed up the house.</p>
                    <p>The hero of this unfortunate episode is named Bernard. He has been a resident
                        at Alexandria for four years past and he is described as an inventor of
                        chemical products. His means of existence are quite unknown but he used to
                        devote considerable time to chemical experiments which annoyed his
                        reighbours considerably. He spent last night in tbe Government Hospital and
                        this morning the French Consular Secretary and Dr. Legrand were appointed
                        Commissioners in Lunacy to examine and report on his mental condition and to
                        discover whether he is actually mad.</p>

                    <p>Speech By Lord Cromer. </p>
                    <p>The laying of the foundation stone of the new Victoria College drew a large
                        and representative gathering to Siouf yesterday afternoon. The ceremony took
                        place in a large tent, which afforded ample accommodation for the hundreds
                        of persons present. The prɔceeding began punctually at 4.30 o'clock. Among
                        the many notables present among the spectators were bis Beatitude Photius
                        II., the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, Yacoub Pacha Artir, Under

                        representatives of the European and native communities. The arrival of Lord
                        and Lady Cromer was greeted by the strains of the National Anthem, and the
                        proceedings began with an address by Mr. E. B. Gould, I. 8. O., British
                        Consul-General at Alexandria, who spoke as follows :</p>
                    <p>"We are gathered to-day to lay the foundation stone of the new Victoria
                        College, and as chairman of the committee, I take this opportunity to
                        express the great gratification we feel at Lord Cromer having consented to
                        perform this. ceremony for us. Our pleasure is very much enhanced by the
                        gracious pre. sence of Lady Cromer. In the name of all present I now tender
                        them our very hearty welcome. I will not on this occasion deal with the
                        history and prospects of the college. These matters will be treated of by
                        subsequent speakers. It will, however, I think, be convenient if I describe
                        briefly the proposed order of the ceremony to-day. First, Baron Jacques de
                        Menasce, as one of the most influential of the original promoters of our
                        school, and as a member of the general and executive committee, will give us
                        a short statement of his views of the progress and prospects of our college.
                        Secondly, Sheikh Mohamed Hamid, the Arabio professor of the college, who has
                        rendered us invaluable service, will pronounce &amp; sbort address in the
                        language of this country. Thirdly, Mr. Preston, the hon. secretary, who has
                        so generously devoted so much of his time to the college, will read, for
                        general information, the scroll which it is proposed to place in the cavity
                        of the foundation stone. He will then submit the scroll to Lord Cromer and |
                        invite him and Lady Cromer to add thereto</p>
                    <p>their signatures. All being thos ready, Mr. | Preston will, on behalf of the
                        committee, ask Lord Cromer to lay the foundation stone. His Lordship will,
                        we trust, before completing the ceremony, favour us with one of those
                        speeches to which we all look for instruction and I guidance. The stone will
                        then be laid and the I proceedings will terminate by &amp; few words from
                        Mr. Lias, the headmaster, to whose remarkable devotion to his difficult and
                        delicate task is due, in the main, the notable success that has thus far
                        attended our enterprise. Baron Menasce said:</p>
                    <p>Milord, Mesdames et Messieurs, </p>
                    <p>La question de l'éducation en commun, qui partout, est un sujet de
                        préoccupation grave pour les familles, était dans ce pays, à une époque
                        récente encore, un problème impossible à résoudre sans de grands sacrifices
                        matériels ou moraux.</p>
                    <p>Confier ses enfants aux établissements religieux, seuls existants alors, et
                        faire ainsi litière de scrupules respectables ; on les envoyer en Europe à
                        grands frais et au prix de cruels déchirements, telles étaient les deux
                        alternatives entre lesquelles on avait à choisir. Et les enfants ainsi
                        élevée, rentraient le plus souvent en étrangers dans le foyer familial, dont
                        il avaient perdu le contact et oublié la douceur</p>
                    <p>Dans une ville d'initiative comme Alex andrie, cette situation n'avait que
                        trop duré et un courant d'opinion finit par se former, en taveur de la
                        création d'une école libre de tonti attache confessionelle. Des réunions
                        furent organisées où l'on discuts les divers systèmes d'éducation. Le
                        système qui fait la part égale entre les exercices de l'esprit et ceux du
                        corps fut unanimement adopté. Des sommes importantes furent souscrites, et,
                        à cette occasion comme en tant d'autres, M. George Alderson nous fit admirer
                        la vertu du silence, et l'éloquence du geste. Un comité international fut
                        élu, comprenant des notabilités de cultes et de nationalités
                        différentes.</p>
                    <p>Sir Charles Cookson, à la mémoire duquel il est de mon devoir, en ce jour, de
                        rendre un hommage ému et reconnaissant, accepta 1 présidence de ce comité
                        dont il fut la cheville ouvrière.</p>
                    <p>Il a en Monsieur Gould un éminent et digne successeur. S'inspirant des
                        traditions de famille de S.A. le Khédive, dont la sollicitude éclairée
                        encourage tout ce qui marque un po dare la voie du progrès et de la
                        civilisation, Gouvernement et la Municipalité concédèrent à prix réduit à
                        l'œuvre naissante, un superbe<cb n="3"/>emplacement qui par la suite devait
                        représenter une fortune.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer lai-même &amp; daigné tenir l'enfant sur les fonts baptismaux, et
                        par une faveur rare, le placer sous l'égide d'un nom illustre, celui de la
                        glorieuse souveraine, dont un grand peuple, à qni nous empruntions son
                        système d'éducation, célébrait, alors le Jubilée.</p>
                    <p>Né sous les plus heureux auspices, filleul d'un homme éminent à tous les
                        égards, qui tr m'en voudrait de dire, tout haut, ce que de lois chacun pense
                        tout bas, le Victoria College ne ignora les vicissitudes du jeune âge, et
                        son développement rapide justifia toutes les faveurs, en dépassant toutes
                        les espérances.</p>
                    <p>Milord, l'édifice dont vous avez posé la première pierre, il y a si peu
                        d'années, est insuffisant aujourd'hui.</p>
                    <p>Pour mettre notre collège à même de ré. pondre à des exigences grandissantes,
                        nous avons décidé de le transporter dans une localité saine entre toutes et

                        appropriés, autour desquels pourront se grouper à l'aise d'autres bâtiments

                        haute direction de Monsieur Lias, à qui le succès, de l'école est dû pour
                        une large part, le Victoria College, c'est affirmé dès le premier jour,
                        comme une oeuvre nécessaire, et il est permis d'en concevoir un orgueil
                        légitime.</p>
                    <p>Et désormais, satisfait du présent, assuré de l'avenir, le Victoria College,
                        pour remplir 808 brillantes destinées, n'a plus qu'à vivre, &amp; prospérer,
                        et comme les héros des contes de fées, à avoir beaucoup d'enfants.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Mohamed Hamed then addressed 1 the gathering in Arabic. The following
                        is a - summary of his speech :</p>
                    <p>The virtues and vices of a nation enter by e the door of education. If
                        instruction be improved and education be suitable to the needs of the
                        people, the results of the two will be a blessing to the country and will
                        produce men 3 that love the truth; who are trustworthy and capable of giving
                        good advice ; men that will be of one mind and have one object in view ;
                        whose memory will live in after days and be remembered in history. But if
                        the contrary, the pillars of the country will fall down. When a boy attains
                        manhood his deeds will be in accordance with what he has learnt as a child.
                        As the thread is woven upon the loom, so will - be the texture of the web.
                        The manners that a child learns are thus interwoven in his nature, and are
                        not merely adornments from without. But earliest impressions are strongest.
                        Therefore there should be a fixed time for a boy's H entering school. In
                        proportion 28 a boy is left to himself so will his character grow strong. We
                        must see, then, that his surroundings are good. We want therefore three
                        things : a fixed time for a boy to enter school; good infigences, and
                        surroundings; perseverance to complete his school course. These are the
                        objects at which we aim in the school of which his Excellency Lord Cromer is
                        just now laying with his own hand the foundation stone; that its foundations
                        may be learning, understanding, and se morality. And I pray that God may
                        help those who are set in authority over us to do that which will bring
                        blessings upon themselves and upon us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. S. Preston then read the text of the scroll placed in the cavity of
                        the stone, which is as follows:-</p>
                    <p>Victoria College is an institution intended by its promoters to provide for
                        the upper classes in Egypt of all nationalities and creeds a school for the
                        education of their sons which would, so far as possible, follow the lines of
                        an English public school. The idea, oliwhich owes its origin to the
                        initiative of ere Sir Charles Cookson, H.B.M.'s Congal-Geon neral in 1897,
                        met at the outset with very considerable support amongst the British
                        community at Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, as well as from the leading
                        members of other communities, notably the Greek, Israelite, Syrian, and
                        Mussulman. A large sum of money was raised and early in 1898 Mr. G. B.
                        Alderson presented the college, then known as the British Schools of Egypt,
                        with the site of some 25,000 square pics on which the present college
                        stands. The funds, however, at the disposal of the College Committee did not
                        admit of a commencement, until in January, 1900, Mr. Alderson again
                        generously came forward with the other of the loan of the funds necessary to
                        enable the buildings to be completed. The school building was begun early in
                        1901 and on the 25th April, 1901, the foundation stone of the first college
                        was laid by Lord Cromer. On the 24th May, 1901, at a general meeting of I
                        promoters, the name of the school was changed to "Victoria College” and the
                        scheme adopted as a memorial to her Most Gracious Majesty the late Queen
                        Victoria. The college first opened its doors to pupils on November 1, 1902,
                        under the head mastership of Mr. C. R. Lias, and during the first year the
                        numbers of the school, which at the opening were 25, rose to 45. Since that
                        date the college has been continuously a success and the average number of
                        pupils at the present day is 186. The growing number of pupils has rendered
                        a large college necessary and the great <cb n="4"/> rise in the value of
                        Alexandria land decided the committee to arrange for the sale of the
                        existing site and the purchase of a larger site farther from the town,
                        where, with the funds so made available, a new college could be built. The
                        site of about 17 feddans, on which this foundation stone is being laid, c.
                        was accordingly purchased in February, 1905, and has since been transferred
                        to the college 1 trustees with the friendly intervention of the Egyptian
                        Government. It is hoped to open the new College in October, 1907. It will
                        provide, accommodation for some 350 papile and will admit of being farther
                        extended to accommodate 500 or even more. The present foundation stone is
                        laid to-day the 24th May, 1906, the anniversary of the birthday of the late
                        Queen, by the Rt. Honble. the Earl of Cromer, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., K.C.S.I.,
                        etc., Acl companied by Lady Cromer. Accompanying this are the first three
                        annual reports of the l' head-master and the hon. treasurer containing also
                        lists of the founders, general com-1. mittee, and executive committee of the
                        College. </p>
                    <p>Before asking Lady Cromer to lay the foundation stone Lord Cromer delivered
                        the following speech :-</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gould, Ladies, and Gentlemen,- When the Victoria College was first
                        instituted, some doubts were expressed as to its fatore. It was wisely
                        decided to move tentatively. These doubts have now been removed. The
                        institution may be said to have passed out of the experimental stage. We are
                        assembled here 12 to-day, on the anniversary of the birthday of: our late
                        revered Queen, to lay the foundation stone of a larger and more complete
                        institution than that which formerly existed. This unquestionable success
                        is, I think, mainly due to two causes. In the first place, it is dae to the
                        persistent efforts of the committee, and notably to the generosity of a
                        fellow-countryman who in many directions has conferred great benefits on the
                        town of Alexandria ; I need hardly say that I allude to Mr. Aldersop. The
                        second cause is that, under the impulse given by Mr. Lias, what is probably
                        the best feature of the English public school system has been introduced. In
                        a recent report, Mr. Lias, paraphrasing an expression of that great
                        schoolmaster, Dr. Arnold, said that he wished to make this college "an
                        epitome of the home." Perhaps it would have buen more correct to say, "a
                        reproduction of the home.” This is what is being done. The masters are
                        brought into close and constant contact with the papils ; and I understand
                        that the committee has, very wisely, decided to introduce the system of
                        house-masterships, thus giving the assistant masters a direct and permanent
                        interest in the institution. Two observations of a more general nature occur
                        to me on the present occasion. One is, that I trust that everyone of
                        influence in this country, in his own sphere of action, will do all in his
                        power to prevent the evil spirit of religious dissension from blocking the
                        path of educational progress, so tar, I am happy to say, that spirit has
                        not, in spite of the great diversity of creeds in this country, shown itself
                        to any considerable extent. There are schools where the Koran is taught, and
                        there are schools where instruction is given in the Bible by the various
                        persuasions of Christiane. Religious instruction in this particular college
                        is, as you are aware, not obligatory. It is, however, given at the request
                        of those parents who desire it, by teachers whom they have themselves
                        chosen. Gentlemen, there is plenty of room in Egypt for schools of all these
                        descriptions. I may add that, though I have been frequently urged to move
                        the Egyptian Government to place its educational policy in the matter of
                        religious teaching on a different, and perhaps somewhat more theoretically
                        defensible, basis than that which now existe, I have always held, and still
                        hold, that this is a case where the homely proverb of "leaving well alone”
                        applies with special force. The main consideration, to my mind, is to let
                        education advance -and it is advancing with rapid strides-without stirring
                        the fires of religious strife. </p>
                    <p>The other point which strikes me is, that the composition of this college is
                        a very good representation in miniature of the cosmopolitan society of
                        Egypt. I am informed that, out of a total of 186 papils, 30 are Christians,
                        67 are Israelites, 39 are Moslems ; whilst as regards nationalities, there
                        are Egyptian, Turkish, Syrian, Armenian, Maltese, Greek, English, French,
                        Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Swiss, and Belgian pupils. There are many such
                        schools and colleges in this country. They cannot fail to do good. In the
                        first place, as regards the relations between Earopeans and native Egyptian,
                        I would fain hope that this amalgamation of races may, in process of time,
                        produce some effect in the direction of removing those misunderstandings
                        which, even to a greater extent than any solid differences of opinion, do
                        much to foster racial animosity ; whilst, as regards Europeans inter se, it
                        may be hoped that the more the rising generation of the various
                        nationalities see of each other, the more they will appreciate a fact of
                        which I have for many years been very fally convinced. It is, that the
                        Europeans resident in Egypt - on whom the progress, whether material or
                        moral, of the country so much depends—are bound<cb n="5"/> together by a
                        common interest. I think I notice, during the last two or three years, a
                        distinct diminution of that petty international rivalry and acerbity which,
                        in the past, has done infinite harm. It is my earnest hope that this healthy
                        movement will grow apace, and that all the educated and influential
                        Europeans in this country will fully realize that they stand together as the
                        representatives and champions of western civilization. For this, amongst
                        other reasons, I welcome the establishment of the Victoria College, as an
                        institution worthy of| the great Sovereign whose name it bears. It will, I
                        trust, help in some degree towards the political and social fusion of the
                        various races who inhabit the valley of the Nile, and who, although they are
                        not all Egyptians in the ordinary and technical sense of the term, deserve
                        that title in its wider, and, as I think, truer sense, in that they are all
                        dwellers in Egypt, and all equally interested in the welfare of the country.
                        In my opinion, it is in the direction of facilitating this fusion that the
                        efforts of all true Egyptian reformers should be turned.</p>
                    <p>Lady Cromer, at his Lordship’s request, then proceeded to lay the foundation
                        stone with the usual formalities, and declared it "well and truly laid."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lias, the headmaster, then made the following remarks :</p>
                    <p>My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen.—'The ceremony we have assembled to see is
                        over. The foundation-stone of our new school has been well and truly laid.
                        The principles of the education in which we believe have been stated in
                        words that we shall not easily forget. The lesson which Lord Cromer
                        impresses on us is one that we can all understand. Let mutual goodwill,
                        then, be the watchword of our new school as it has been of the old. If
                        Victoria College during its first four years has prospered even beyond
                        expectation it is not a little because the boys, their parents, the masters
                        and the committee have known how to work together. We are of many
                        nationalities and of different creeds, but may we not justly say that in
                        aims and aspirations we are one? We are all proud of our school. We all wish
                        to make it worthy of the honoured name it bears. Ladies and Gentlemen, We
                        appreciate your kindness in joining us this afternoon, and I am sure that
                        you will associate yourselves with me, when, on behalf of the masters and
                        boys of Victoria College, I offer our sincere thanks to Mr. Gould and the
                        committee for inviting as to this interesting ceremony, and to Lord and Lady
                        Cromer, whose help and presence are so great an honour to our school</p>
                    <p>After three cheers for Lord and Lady Cromer and Mr. G. B. Alderson, there was
                        an adjournment to the buffet. All the arrangements in this respect had been
                        entrusted to Mr. Landader, of the San Stefano Hotel Casino, and it is
                        needless to state that they were excellent.</p>
                    <p>The site of the new school is approached from Rae-el-Akbal between the Palace
                        tramway station and the main road from Alexandria to Siont. The site
                        comprises seventeen feddans and was purchased from the Egyptian Trust and
                        Investment and the Building Lands of Egypt at the rate of fifteen piastres
                        tarif per pic. These two companies possess a million and a half square pics
                        in the immediate neighbourhood and intend to develop considerably this part
                        of Ramleh. Mr. Glymenopoulo has had a station constructed close by, which is
                        called "Victoria College".</p>
                    <p>The tramway arrangements for the conveyance of Lord Cromer and party were
                        very good and redounded greatly to the credit of M. Jacot des Combes.</p>

                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer spent last night at San Stefano Hotel. This morning they
                        visited the Mohamed Aly Industrial School, where they were received by some
                        of the leading members of the Moslem Benevolent Society of Alexandria (El
                        Orwa el Wuska). Afterwards Lord and Lady Cromer went to the barbour and
                        inspected the new pass and the works in progress. They were accompanied by
                        Admiral Lambton, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, Director General of Ports and
                        Lights, Mr. E. B. Gould, H.B.M's Consul-General, etc. The party proceeded in
                        the Tier el Mina, which was followed by a pilot boat and a steam launch.
                        After inspecting the pass the party went on board the steam launch, in which
                        they proceeded to Mex and afterwards to Gabbary, returning subsequently to
                        the ArseDal landing stage.</p>

                        their town from a gouvernorat to a markoz. Three of the delegation met H.E.
                        Mnstapha Pacha Fohmy at the Ministry of the Interior and laid their
                        grievances before him.</p>
                    <p>The party then proceeded to the British Agency, where they left a petition in

                        enquired for Mr. Machell, to whom they propose to submit their grievances on
                        his return from the provinces. They also propose visiting Alexandria with a
                        view to laying their grievances before H.H. the Khedive.</p>

                        <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                        <p>Port-Said, Thursday, </p>
                        <p>The report last Friday morning that torpedo boat No. 56 had suffered a
                            doleful disaster spread rapidly through the town. A few hours after the
                            departure of the Astilla a storm of such severity arose as to delay the
                            traffic in the Canal until midday. The news did not surprise those who
                            are acquainted with the dangers of navigating such craft near this coast
                            in rough weather.</p>
                        <p>Torpedo boat No. 64, which, rumour had it, was the missing boat, did not
                            proceed to sea with the others, having gone into dock to have her
                            machinery overhauled. She is now in fighting trim again and will shortly
                            rejoin her fellows at Malta.</p>

                            through drill on shore, a source of endless interest to natives and
                            others. A familiar sight in our town now is their well known pet I bex,
                            which is reported to have swallowed a London paper which has recently
                            given great prominence to the prowess in swimming of some of those who
                            went to El Arish. </p>

                            from Tsing Tau with nearly 2,000 German troops. Contrary to the
                            regulations in force in Egyptian ports the troops disembarked wearing
                            side arms. However, on the protest of Schalk Bey, Commandant of the
                            Police, to the German Consul the matter was rectified.</p>
