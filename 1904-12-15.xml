                <head>PORT ARTHUR.</head>
                <p>The latest London newspapers to hand contain most interesting accounts of the
                    terribly dramatic finale of the Port Arthur Fleet. One by one the Russian Navy
                    in the Far East has been knocked out of action by the methodical Japanese.
                    Taking as few risks as possible with their own precious and none too numerous
                    battleships and cruisers, Togo, Kamimura and Uriu have slowly but thoroughly
                    wrested from Russia any pretension to sea-power. One by one, as occasion
                    offered, after that first magnificent dash by the destroyer flotilla I which
                    found the Russians making merry or asleep while their country's honor depended
                    on watchful efficiency, the Russian ships have been accounted for. The Varyag'
                    and "Koreitz" were extinguished together at Chemulpo. The “Rurik” was hainmered
                    out of existence in the Vladivostok cruisers' action with Kamimura Cunctator,
                    the plucky little "Novik” was driven ashore soon afterwards, the “Petropavlovsk”
                    was destroyed by a mine, no doubt by &amp; designed and Japanese chain-mine, and
                    the disastrous sortie of August accounted for more being put out of action, with
                    the result that when the more disastrous return was made to the precarious
                    shelter of Port Arthur harbour, only the battleships "Poltava,” “Peresviet,"
                    "Pobieda," "Sevastopol," and "Retvisan,” with the cruiser "Bayan," remained out
                    of the fine fleet commanded by Admiral Stark when the war broke</p>

                <p>out. Since the Japanese assaulted with success 203 Metre Hill, obviously the key
                    to the Russian defence, more disasters have followed. The “Poltava" has been
                    sunk where she lay at anchor, the "Retvisan" is on her beam ends, it is reported
                    that the | "Peresviet" has gone down, the “Bayan” has run aground, while the
                    "Pobieda” and | “Pallada" have received a fearful and shattering fire from the
                    captured eminence which dominates the harbour. All is thus plainly finished for
                    the Port Arthur remnant. At Vladivostok the naval situation is quite as
                    desperate. The "Gromoboi" and "Bogatry" are not fit to put to sea, even if
                    neither of them has gone to pieces, and the “Rossia” is in no better case. The
                    Japanese squadrons, | in fact, refitted and repainted and probably | little the
                    worse for all the fighting, can now | turn their undivided attention to the
                    Baltio Armada when, or if, it comes. Only destruction Trån lia before it. To
                    prodaonta the forlorn hope seems the veriest madness, and unless the ill-manned,
                    ill-disciplined, and hetero. geneous squadrons are recalled at once, it may be
                    too late to save them from the fate that has overtaken their fellows and
                    predecessors, </p>
                <p>This destruction of the Port Arthur Fleet, Tas it lay at anchor within the
                    shell-stricken harbour, has all the drama of tragedy. One must inevitably
                    suppose that they have been thus ignobly and pitiably destroyed because they
                    were already, before tho Japanese had secured their position on 203 Metre Hill,
                    incapable of steaming or fighting. Had a single" ship been able to get out of
                    the deadly harbour and run for death or glory firing even half her guns it is
                    inconceivable that the desperate attempt should not have been made. It then
                    becomes practically certain that the ships have been helplessly and hopelessly
                    shattered for some time. At the same time this does not explain, nor is it
                    possible to understand, the absence of any previous attempt to break out by the
                    Port Arthur Fleet. After the disastrous sortie, ill-managed and not pushed to
                    its logical conclusion, these ships were certainly capablo of some sort of
                    fight. Obviously the loss of one Japanese battleship would have been worth their
                    destruction, and why they made no at tempt to do some serious damage to their
                    enemy before their careers as Russian iron clads were finished is something
                    difficult to understand. It looks like a continuation of that incompetence and
                    indecision which has reduced Russia to an insignificant position amongst the
                    Naval Powers of the world, and has even, as military critics in Russia are
                    candidly writing, lost her the war. Possibly the Port Arthur ships were waiting
                    for the magical Armada, which was blundering abont in the North Sea and creeping
                    out at a snail's pace while every minute was worth its weight in gold. There
                    would have been something stirring and melodramatic in that final and torlorn
                    sortie which we have been expecting any time these last three months. The
                    deepest tragedy surrounds this desperate end without a blow struck in
                    self-defence. </p>
                <p>For ourselves there is a moral to be drawn from what has happened at Port Arthur.
                    The prime importance of séa-power has never, since the day of Trafalgar, been so
                    clearly demon: strated. We have only to turn to the frank pessimism of Russian
                    military critics to learn how much has depended, does and will depend, on the
                    command of the sea. It is already recognised that Russia cannot bring the war to
                    a successful conclusion unless the arrival of the Baltic Fleet changes the whole
                    aspect of the naval situation. Failing that miracle it is beginning to be said
                    that the war must come to a swift and ignominious end, and that it is &amp;
                    miracle rather to be prayed for, as Port Arthur once was prayed for, than
                    reasonably expected, is as clearly recognised. Japan has won, 80 far, because
                    her ships were ready and efficient. Our ships are ready and efficient, too, and
                    we need have, perhaps, no fear on that score, though the vitalimportance of an
                    overwhelming ly powerful Navy for us is the one thing we can never afford to
                    lose sight of, </p>

                    <p>LONDON, December 14.</p>
                    <p>The Daily Telegraph learns from Chifu that a messenger from Dalny states that
                        another Japanese warship, larger than the Saiyen, was also šunk on the 30th
                        ult. off Port Arthur by a torpedo-boat.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese cruisers sank two Russian torpedo-boats of Port Arthur on the
                        25th ult.</p>
                    <p>Reuter's correspondent before Port Arthur says that the effect of the
                        dynamite grenades was appalling in the recent fighting. The dead were so
                        torn to pieces that they were merely an unrecognisable mass of flesh, bones
                        and fragments. The hundreds of killed unearthed from the unfilled trenches
                        presented an awful spectacle of horror. Heavy timber and steel plates from
                        the bomb-proofs were shattered into splinters. (Reuter.)</p>

                        is of foreign origin. In the Babylonian language the word should be schabtu,
                        from waschab, to settle, to repose. The word sabat is a direct reproduction
                        of the Arabic thabat, from wathaba, to settle, the Arabic th not being
                        represented in Babylonian except by the letter s., The second part of the

                    an exhaustive report, similar to that which M. Julledière made on the railways
                    of India for the authorities in Indo-China. This mission, whioh is well worth
                    attention in England and the Colonies, is significant of the thoroughness with
                    which the French have of late years taken up Colonial questions. Nothing is now
                    left to chance, but everything is carefully studied, and the advances which have
                    been made in West Africa and Madagascar show that the French are determined to
                    do away with the reproach of pot being a colonising nation. A little more
                    enterprise among private citizens is all they need to make their Colonial
                    possessions successful from every point of view.</p>

                <head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET</head>
                <p>(From our FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>London, December 9.</p>
                <p>The weather and the vagaries of the Yankee manipulators have had more to do with
                    the depression of the Stock Markets during the last few days than matters
                    political. The former has | for days past been of the "vile" order—wet and
                    depressing. The latter are progressing steadily and surely to the end already
                    foreshadowed in my former articles. The recent doings at Port Arthur are all
                    against the war party in St. Petersburg ; consequently those who are workJing
                    for peace, are more hopeful that theirlabours will bear fruit. I understand the
                    efforts of our neighbours across the Channel have made distinct headway in the
                    right direction during the last few days.</p>
                <p>Egyptian Stocks have given way somewhat since our last from the above causes,
                    although they continue to steer a course of their own. The Cotton Market
                    situation has had an adverse effect on prices in this market, more especially on
                    the Bank shares, Nationals having dropped to 23 and Agriculturals to 10 id. Land
                    shares keep steady, Daira Sugar keep very firm at 5%, and there has undoubtedly
                    been influential support on this side, as Paris was a fairly large seller warly
                    in the week, but this had little effect on the market. Apart from the rise in
                    sugar, these shares have an intrinsic value of their own and are worth watching.
                    Salt and Soda hold their price well at 2 and might easily have another upward
                    run. The late general manager, with his block of deferred shares, however,
                    should have something to say regarding the proposed amalgamation.</p>
                <p>In general markets the main points of interest have been the Japanese successes
                    at Port Arthur, which were however pretty fully discounted, and the sharp break
                    yesterday in the American Market on the fall in Amalga mated Copper. Americans
                    were very wild for some time, but the recovery was even more rapid than the
                    fall, as London took most of the cheap Stock. Kaffies are neglected, but there
                    is not really much set-back in prices, and the | undertone is good. Egyptian
                    Mining shares have been weak during the last few days, Nile Valleys having
                    falleu to 2), and United Afrisans to 11. At this level they should be worth
                    attention as there is a general and confident feeling that we shall see renewed
                    activity in the mining section. The company we mentioned a fortnight ago — The
                    Corporation of Western Egypt - is, we hear, being steadily applied for and
                    likely to go well. The names of the | Cairo board should certainly inspire
                    confidence. </p>
                <p>There is little to say of general business which has been on a small scale, as is
                    generally the case at the end of the year, but opinion that the New Year will
                    bring a further revival seems general.</p>

                <head>RAMADAN IN HYDE PARK.</head>
                <p>A REMARKABLE AND IMPRESSIVE SERVICE.</p>
                <p>A London correspondent, writing unter date of Friday last, remarks:</p>
                <p>There could be no greater contrast in the ethics associated with Marble Arcb,
                    Hyde Park, than the simple devotions of a little band of Mahomedans which
                    assernbled this morning to offer : “Prayers to Allah and Ma.. homed his
                    Prophet," and the nondescript and often impious meetings which take place there
                    every Sunday afternoon. There was no muezzin to call the faithful to their
                    devotions, but the rain and the cold did not appear to affect the attendance or
                    damp the religious fervour of the devotees.</p>
                <p>This was the first day of Beyram, and the celebration was arranged by the
                    PanIslamic Society. Between thirty and forty Moslems, some wearing turbans and
                    armed with mats of linoleum, which were spread on the wet ground, assembled at
                    eleven o'clock. The celebration was of a remarkable and most impressive
                    character. When the chief priest, robed, in Mahomedan canonicals, commenced the
                    prayer to Allah, the worshippers fell on their knees in two rows, with their
                    faces towards the East. At the close of the prayer the people bowed low and
                    kissed the ground twice. After a hymn a second prayer was devoutly offered up,
                    and again the devotees kissed the ground twice, and when they rose from their
                    knees they embraced each other in Moslem fashion, and the celebration was at an
                    end.</p>
                <p>The Mahomedan community in London have no mosque, but plans have been prepared
                    for the erection of one of architectural magnificence, with a dome 200 feet

                <head>MR. WALTER HICKS. </head>
                <p>There appears to be some fatality about the managership of the Imperial Ottoman
                    Bank at Cairo, for the death of Mr. Moxley was soon followed by that of Mr.
                    Wood, and now we regret to announce the death of Mr. Walter Hicks, manager of
                    the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Cairo, who expired at 11.15 o'clock last night from
                    cerebral hæmorrhage. Mr. Hicks was born in 1855, and entered the service of the
                    bank at the age of 16. He had successively been controller at the bank's Port
                    Said agency, chief accountant at Alexandria, and sub-manager and manager at
                    Cairo. He was appointed manager at Cairo in May this year, in succession to Mr.
                    Wood.</p>
                <p>Mr.Hicks went for a drive yesterday afternoon, when he was seized with an
                    apoplectic attack.He was taken home and appeared to be going on as well as could
                    be expected when death ensued from the above-mentioned cause. His funeral takes
                    place this afternoon at 2.30, from the Imperial Ottoman Bank. </p>
                <p>Mr. Hicks leaves a widow and two daughters, one aged about 12 and the other about
                    6, to whom we tender our deep sympathy.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE YOUSBASHI ARMSTRONG.</head>
                    <p>To The EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—As there appears to be no doubt as to the fact that the late Yousbashi
                        Armstrong caught confluent small-pox while convalescent in hospital, I think
                        that in justice to that excellent institution, the German Deaconesses'
                        Hospital at Alexandria, the authorities of the hospital ought to hold an
                        enquiry into the matter. As there does not exist in Egypt any hospital
                        reserved for infectious cases, the, unfortunate death of this young
                        Englishman will cause considerable apprehension to all those who in future
                        have to go into hospital. For the sake of the public, and in the interests
                        of the hospital, a careful investigation should be made into the
                        circumstances attending this is tragical affair. Surely it is high time for
                        the Egyptian Government to build a small-pox hospital. Small-pox is
                        prevalent in Egypt : last year 2,118 cases occurred, If it is so infectious
                        It! that a patient in a hospital, recovering from an illness, can contract
                        the disease without contact, but merely through the medium of the air, then
                        nobody in a hospital is safe if there is a small-pox case under treatment at
                        the same time.</p>

                    <p>"COMMON-SENSE." </p>

                        being condemned to die at their posts.--Can nothing be done to avoid this?
