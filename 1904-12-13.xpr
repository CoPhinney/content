                                the Tigris and Euphrates. The British population of Egypt has
                                increased enormously since the judicial functions of the Consulate
                                here were restricted, on the retirement of Sir Charles Cookson, and
                                the cases which come within the purview of the Supreme Consular
                                Court are constantly growing in number and importance. The hardship
                                inflicted on the parties concerned is oftentimes considerable. For
                                example, in the Assouan shooting case, the defendant had to wait for
                                months before his trial, and the mental strain of the suspense must
                                have been very trying. The expense attendant on the judge's journeys
                                to Egypt must come to a considerable sum every yea,r and this would
                                be economised by the establishment of a permanent divisional court
                                of the Supreme Consular Court in Egypt, which could be made to
                                conveniently embrace the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, where
                                shipping cases of some importance occasionally arise. Such an

                            <p>It is estimated that 50 students were wounded yesterday. The rioting
                                was organised by the revolutionary Socialists, and not by the
                                Liberal Reformers. Another demonstration is expected next Tuesday
                                when the trial of M. Plehve's assassin begins. (<hi rend="italic"

                                the excess committed by the reservists at Vitebak and elsewhere, the
                                peasantry are revolting against the Government in Ekaterinoslav,
                                Hazan, and Saratoff. The official added that Court was anxious
                                concerning the issue of the tremendous struggle between Prince

                                father of Omar Bey Loutfy, the well-known native advocate and
                                professor at, and sub-director of, the Khedivial Law School. The
                                deceased was an Algerian, but a local subject, and was staying at an
                                hotel at Alexandria when he succumbed suddenly yesterday morning.
                                The mortal remains were taken to the house of Said Mohamed el Tiafah
                                by the Mosque of Aboul Abbas at Bab Sidra. The deceased was 55 years
                                of age. We beg to tender our sympathy to Omar Bey Loutfy, who is one

                            <p> The above opera, which was produced at Paris in 1835, was the final
                                work of the celebrated composer Bellini, who died at the early age
                                of 33. The music is melodious and passionate, the score soft and
                                majestic. The interpretation of the work yesterday evening WAS,
                                frankly, mediocre. The tenor Andreini sang well the admirable
                                romances and duos which frequently occur; the part of Lord Arthur
                                demands, however, a tenor with a more extended scope of voice. The
                                baritone Nani and the bass Walter, in the roles of Sir George and
                                Sir Richard Forth, were very successful. The celebrated duet in the
                                3rd act had to be repeated by them. Signa. A. Tromber possesses a
                                soprano voice which she exercises with incomparable agility. She was
                                greatly applauded in the 3rd |act. </p>

                            <p>On the whole a good performance, the mise en scène being as good as ever and the orchestra in fine form. Faust was a little uninteresting, and Siebel, to put it mildly, disappointing, but Siga. Malaspina, after beginning a little nervously, sang really well as Marguerite, though there was the least suspicion of strain  about her high note. Mephistopheles (Sig. Badini) began magnificently, and his rendering of the “Route du Veau d'or” was one of the best we have heard, but he got out of tune curiously out of tune, at the close of the serenade, the one blot on what was otherwise a very fine performance. The soldiers' chorus was as well received as ever, but we regret that the song assigned to Siebel in the 4th act, and "cut" by almost every conductor, was given at all. In the first place, it is a song for the drawing-room, not the opera, and in the second, it was manifestly impossible for Siebel to do justice to it. The "apotheosis" bordered on the comic.</p>

                                A singularly daring attempt at highway robbery has been frustrated by the Assiout police. It appears that a local Capt, a business man of the town, was believed to be in the habit of taking large sums of money with him while driving home from his business house at night. A gang of criminals planned to attack his carriage and rob him at a stop on the Hamra road not very far from the railway station, where a high dura crop was growing on each side and afforded an excellent hiding-place and means of escape. The police were warned of the projected attack and after several nights their vigilance was rewarded. Four policemen in civilian dress, driving slowly in a covered carriage past the dura field, were suddenly assailed by the robbers, one of whom was overpowered and captured in the scuffle that followed. The rest escaped, after an exchange of shots, into the corn.

But the condition of these graves at the present time is disgraceful. Old petroleum and milk tins and native refuse lie about on the graves.

                                For almost two years Suez had been anxiously awaiting the electric light installation, and finally the streets were brilliantly lighted up &amp; couple of months ago, the inhabitants being delighted with the result. It now appears that the Municipality, for economy's sake, extinguishes several lamps in the streets after midnight, and consequently the town was far better off before with the petroleum lamps than it is at present. It is really very important for at least the landing-stages to be kept lighted up the whole night, as it must be taken into consideration that several steam launches belonging to steamship agencies embark and disembark passengers at any time before and after midnight. In order to avoid any accidents on account of the darkness, the lamps there should be left lighted during the whole night.

                            Diplomatic and Consular Corps, by the International Chamber of
                            Navigation at Alexandria, through its president, Mr. J. Ricard, the
                            Chamber begins by pointing out the great advance which has been made of
                            recent years in the trade of the port of Alexandria. They call his
                            lordship's attention to the "considerable and continual prejudice caused
                            to navigation and commerce by the inadequate quay accommodation
                            provided, and appeal to his lordship's initiative to obtain - radical
                            remedy for the present unsatisfactory state of things with as little
                            loss of time 18 possible."</p>
                        <p>The petition then quotes figures showing the remarkable development in
                            the shipping and trade of the port. The number of vessels entering and
                            leaving the harbour rose from 2,112 in 1880 to 3,005 in 1903, and during
                            this period the tonnage increased from 2,046,000 to 3,160,000, i. e. 50
                            per cent. With regard to merchandise, there was an increase in value
                            From £.E.20,000,000 in 1884 to £.E.36,000,000 in 1904.</p>
                        <p>Everything pointed to the growing prosperity of Egypt, and under such
                            conditions it was evident that the traffic in the port of Alexandria
                            would go on increasing, keeping pace with the important works being
                            carried out in the interior. The Chamber thinks that sufficient
                            provision has not been made for this future development, and says that,
                            notwithstanding the recent allocation in the 1905 Budget of a zum of
                            £.E.178,000 for the improvement of the port and customs accommodation,
                            it will be a long time before the authorities will be able to cope, by
                            what they call half measures, with the rapid and certain development of
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>The Chamber then points out the difficulties which steamers have to
                            contend with in the port, owing to lack of berth space. The movements of
                            ships are considerably hindered and the unloading of the vessels is
                            sometimes carried out with the greatest difficulty. This deplorable
                            situation has been most keenly felt by the timber-carrying steamers.
                            Notwithstanding the enormous increase in the imports of wood, no new
                            quay has been built for the unloading of these steamers during the past
                            year. The captains of eleven of these steamers, several of which lay in
                            the harbour over a month, have recently had recourse to the Mixed
                            Courts,and other vessels, belonging to regular lines, which would not
                            accost the quays nor find lighters to unload, have had to delay
                            discharging for a considerable time. The situation has therefore become
                            incontestably acute, and it can only rapidly become more so. In the
                            Chamber's opinion, it calls for, not partial or provisional measures,
                            but the immediate adoption of an elaborate plan, and the granting of
                            sufficient sums to put the port of Alexandria as soon as possible in a
                            condition to cope with every eventuality.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Chamber suggests the institution of a special
                            Commission, on which would be represented all interested parties, to
                            consider the present situation in every detail and draw up &amp; plan
                            capable of meeting, as soon as possible, all the requirements which the
                            continual development of shipping and commerce may necessitate.</p>

The only possible rival to this "Mille Nuits et une Nuit'' is Burton's English version, while M.

                        <head>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</head>
                            <p>The British S.S. Guildhall arrived here on 28th ulto, from England
                            with material for the Suakin-Atbara Railway, such as iron bridges,
                            sleepers, etc. </p>
                        <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, Director of the Sudan Railways, was a passenger by
                            the Guildhall from Suez to Suakin. On Macaplay Bey's arrival here
                            Bimbashi Longfield, R.E., Assistant Director, Sudan Railways, returned
                            to RailI head, which is now about 40 miles away from Suakin, this being
                            the third station. </p>
                        <p>Bimbashi Lord, R.E., has had a relapse and is still confined to his room. </p>
                        <p>The Suakin condensers are still followed by ill-luck. I mentioned lately
                            the arrival of Mr. Maylor to put them up. He was the third engineer sent
                            out from England for that purpose, the former two having had to return
                            home as being medically unfit for Suakin. As soon as Mr. Maylor arrived
                            he caught fever and was laid up for several days. I am glad to say he is
                            now better.</p>
                        <p> The Europeans resident here are greatly increasing in numbers, more
                            especially Englishmen, most of whom are in the Government service. </p>
                        <p>Several bars, provision stores,and restaurants have been opened since the
                            beginning of last month. Amongst them may be noted the New Bar and
                            provision stores of Mr. "George, the Splendid Bar of Mr. Capato, the
                            well-known contractor, and the Grand Suakin Restaurant of Mr. Elia, the
                            caterer for the Government steamers on the Shellal-Wady Halfa reach.</p>
                        <p> Last week we had constant rain. The weather is now mild and cool. The
                            fields are beginning to look green, and we expect plenty of vegetables
                            and fruit this winter. All the cattle are now out on the hills grazing,
                            and milk and butter are getting plentiful and cheap in the market. </p>

                            <p> OPENING CONCERT OF SEASON. "A thorough and well-deserved success,"
                            was the unanimous verdict of all those privileged to be present at the
                            opening concert of the above well-known society given at Abbat's Hotel
                            last Saturday night. The feature of the evening was the début of the
                            newly-formed Choral Union, whose performance reflected the greatest
                            credit on their able conductor Mr. Sarjeant, to whose efforts their
                            striking success is without doubt due. Owing to the scarcity of copies
                            of the part-songs given on Saturday, the number of those taking part was
                            necessarily small. However, &amp; quantity of music is expected to
                            arrive shortly from England, and the Choral Union will then be doubtless
                            greatly augmented. This en passant. The concert opened with a chorus
                            from Barnett's Ancient Mariner entitled “The Ship was cheered." This was
                            well rendered by members of the Choral Union (Lady Blomfield, Miss
                            MunGavin, Miss Cree, Miss Steiger, Mrs. Roberts, Miss Neil, Miss Smith,
                            Mesers. J. Purvis, A. H. Jennings, H. M. Blomfield, P. Byrne, L. Nixon,
                            W. S. Watt, and E. P. Rees. Mr. Edgar Fiteni followed with two solos on
                            the violin. It was unfortunate that his charming rendering of Svendsen's
                            well-known Romance should have been somewhat marred by the
                            accompaniment, which had evidently not been carefully studied. Auber's
                            "La Muta di Portici," how-a ever, was well performed by soloist and
                            accompanist alike and much appreciated. A song by Mr. Byrne was the next
                            on the list. This was “The Rosary" by Nevin, and was given with great
                            taste and feeling. The last two items of Part I were reserved for the
                            two "stars" of the evening. Mrs. Haddad played two pianoforte solos, one
                            by Henselt, "Si oiseau j'étais à toi je volerais," which was followed by
                            a Romance of Rubinstein. These she played with all her accustomed skill,
                            the Romance being particularly well rendered. Mrs. Cree brought this
                            part of the concert to a close with two songs in which she delighted her
                            audience. The first, a charming little song accompanied by the composer,
                            M. Felix, and the second "Chanson Tsigane, " by Brahms, which had to be
                            repeated. </p>
                        <p>Part II. opened with the well-known part song "An Old Romance" by
                            Mendelssohn. This was admirably rendered by the Choral Union, and must
                            have gladdened the heart of their genial conductor. In response to the
                            demands of the audience it was repeated with even greater success. Two
                            violin solos now followed, both delightfully played by Miss E.
                            Lang-Anderson. Great credit is due to her for playing her first piece so
                            well in spite of unfortunate interruptions from an adjacent window.
                            However, the "gamins” in the street being dispersed, the audience were
                            able to enjoy uninterruptedly her excellent performance of Carl Bobm's
                            well-known "Perpetuo Mobile," which was heartily encored. Mrs. Cree once
                            more enchanted her audience with a beautiful rendering of Beethoven's
                            "Adelaide." Being of course recalled, she repeated the song with as
                            great success as ever. Mr. Byrne followed with a charming little ditty
                            about "Two eyes of blue," from The Silver Slipper. As an encore be sang
                            "The Pearl of Sweet Ceylon," from The Cingalee, in &amp; style worthy of
                            Mr. Haydn Coffin. A wonderful performance of Liszt's "Rhapsodie
                            Hongroise" was Mrs. Haddad's second contribution. Her audience demanded
                            a further exhibition of this talented player's powers, but owing to the
                            lateness of the hour Mrs. Haddad decided not to treat her hearers to an
                            encore. The last item on the programme was a beautiful song composed by
                            the singer's sister, Mrs. Dandridge, which Mr. Sarjeant rendered with
                            great feeling. The National Anthem, sung with much "verve" by a
                            patriotic trio at the end of the concert-room, brought a highly
                            successful concert to a close. The heartiest thanks of the society are
                            due to Mr. Abbat for so kindly placing the room at their disposal for
                            the evening. </p>
