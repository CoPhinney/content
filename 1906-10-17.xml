                        <p>The programme of the founders of the proposed National University should
                            have the effect of modifying the criticisms passed in advance upon that
                            institution. The fears to which some of our Egyptophobes—for there ar:
                            Egyptophobes as well as Anglophobes to be found in Cairo and
                            Alexandria-gave utterance, presaging a "Nationalist" University with
                            Miata as Pasha Kamel or some vigorous and intolerant member of the olema
                            class as its R:otor, are shown to be groundlees, and the pronouncement
                            of the committee that the doors of the new University shall be thowa oj
                            on to all, whatever their origin and their religion, who desire to
                            learn, and that its constitution shall be entirely independent of
                            political ir flaenops, is reassuring. Nor is the programme of the
                            University courses too restricted, while none can accuse it of a lack of
                            idealism. In fact, even some of the sympathisers with the movement may
                            feel a certain doubt whether those who have drawn up the programme may
                            not have sought to soar, like Icarus, too near the sun on their first
                            flight. But we should like to remind our readers that Kassim Bey Amin's
                            letter does not contain a definite programme : the University will not
                            open to-morrow, nor will students crowd to Cairo this winter to attend
                            its lectures. Some years of patient work are required before the
                            University can be finally established. Funds must be raised and a site
                            must be chosen.</p>
                        <p>The constitution of the governing body must be determined, and professors
                            discovered, who are capable of teaching Oriental students. We will refer
                            later to some of these points, Mean-</p>

                        <p>time, we must realise that we have to do with a very admirable and
                            public-spirited proposal made by men who ze spirit ia progressive, whose
                            enthusiasm is unbounded, and whose aims are free from the taint of self
                            interest. To those who assert that the motives of the promoters of the
                            scheme are interested, we reply that if the University is to be a
                            successful and well-organized foundation, there will be no room for
                            private profit. The founders will, indeed, obtain some of the immaterial
                            rewards of public spirit--the criticism of the ignorant and the praise
                            of the enlightened : but, even should their first essay be unfruitful,
                            their names will be famous among their compatriots and also among all
                            men whom love of knowledge and admiration of a genuinely patriotic
                            spirit render indifferent to the distinctions of creed and race. And in
                            the days to come such men will abound.</p>
                        <p>Our critics--we foresee their appearance--may deny our premises. But,
                            after all, if they assert that the scheme will founder through disunion,
                            they must remember that the newborn zeal for education may yet carry
                            Egyptians safely past the Scylla of jealousy and the Charybdis of
                            intrigue, and if they want that the scheme is doomed to fall into
                            dishonest hands, we--can only reply that if the University Committee
                            diverts the subscriptions it will receive into improper channels, and
                            not only we but all Egypt--are absolutely mistaken in our judgment of
                            the honesty and single-mindedness of its members.</p>
                        <p>We have remarked that the programme which Kassab Bey Amin bas suggested
                            and outlined may not meet with the approval of all the world. But it is
                            capable of modification, and if the public to which it is addressed has
                            criticism to offer, none can doubt that ita criticisms will have weight.
                            Bat we should like to point out that till now the corse of Egyptian
                            education has been the view taken by <!--[illegible]--> and Moslems
                            alike, that education exists b enable young men to obtain positions
                            order Government or to crowd certain professions that once were
                            lucrative but are now over-crowded by the multitude of competitors. Wo
                            admit that education in the present state of society must be for most a
                            means to such an e.d. Batman shall not live by bread alone. "The nations
                            have succeeded best which have aimed as far as possible at a wide
                            training—the training of the mind and of the body, and the training of
                            the will. China is the classic instance of failure, dae not so much to
                            the predominance of a purely literary education, as to the prevalence of
                            the idea that the be all and end-all of education was the supply of
                            mandarins. France and England at the present day, Rome and Greece in the
                            past, have realised that such over-specialisation is almost as dangerous
                            as neglect to the body politic, that education when possible must be
                            something more than a means to wealth.</p>
                        <p>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas applies too well to an education
                            that is concentrated on the production of money-makers.. A modern State
                            does not require citizens turned out like coin from a mint-aniform,
                            stamped with the same pattern and the same milling. It needs numbers and
                            variety, specialists and handicraftsman, active workers and watchful
                            critics ; even the idle rich-pace our Socialista -have their value once
                            their intellects or their characters or both have been disciplined or
                            trained. A millionaire may devote his wealth to the advancement of
                            knowledge ; a poor man may become a leader in the councils of his
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Thus far neither the Egyptian Government nor the Egyptian people have had
                            the time or the means to create a University. A system of secɔndary "and
                            technical education has achieved much, bat it hus not given-por in the
                            nature of things could it give-the opportunity to zealous students of
                            acquiring a wider knowledge. The young Egyptian of means has too often

                            <head>LONDON OPINION.</head>
                            <p>The way in which the London money market has been drained to meet the
                            Egyptian demand lead the "Statist" to remark :- "It is too early yet to
                            estimate with any confidence the probable Egyptian demand. Until
                            recently that demand was expected to be emall, because speculation is
                            much less active than it was at this time last year. Now opinion has
                            changed, and it is feared that the demand will be large. Quite possibly,
                            in a little time farther we may see another change of opinion, or the
                            Bank of France may decide upon supplying Egypt freely. It would not be
                            wise, however, to depend upon that. Ever since 1870 the policy of the
                            Bank of France has been to keep as large an amount of gold as it
                            possibly can. Just now there are many reasons why the Bank of France
                            should think it desirable to maintain that policy. The State of Russia,
                            the general distur. bance of the political equilibrium in Europe, the
                            uprost among the Mohamedans, and the uneasiness at home, pre-all reasons
                            why the Bank of France should think it desirable to part with very large
                            amounts. It is true that there has been a very considerable decrease in
                            the gold held by the Bank of France. But then it is not possible from
                            the returns to ascertain to what extent that decrease is for internal
                            and to what extent for external requirements. Therefore for the present
                            it would be best to assume that the Egyptian demand upon this country -
                            will be nearly as large as in recent years."</p>

                            events which have occurred in Egypt during his lordship’s absence. The
                            poet points on that the Egyptians have not changed and never will, but
                            the obarge brought against them after the Denishwai incident was a
                            bitter pill for them. Addressing his stanzas to Lord Cromer, the poet
                            adds: "Had you been here to see the Donishwai affair people would not
                            have been tortured."</p>

                        <head>DISORDERLY CONDUCT IN CAIRO</head>
                    <p>Yesterday morning, the hearing of a summons brought by Mr. Marburg,
                        proprietor of the St. James's Hotel, against Mrs. Adams took place at
                        H.B.M.'s Consular Court, Cairo. The defendant was represented by Maitre
                        Geoffrey Miward.</p>
                    <p>It appears that a few days ago, Mrs. Adama's little daughter entered the St.
                        James's Hotel, where she fell into conversation with a couple of officers,
                        who gave her ices, sweets, etc. And appears to have become , rather excited,
                        and eventually began to throw ices from the window of the hotel on to the
                        beads of those who were having supper below. This conduct naturally provoked
                        a scene, and the child - was requested to leave the hotel, the proprietor of
                        which giving orders that she should not be admitted in future.</p>
                    <p>On the following evening Mrs. Adams appeared, and sitting down at a table
                        which was already occupied, began to talk loudly, to the diners, who seem to
                        have objected, and Mrs. Adams was ordered to leave the hotel. At about three
                        o'clock in the morning, she re-appeared, driving up in company with her
                        husband and daughter, and entered the, hotel, where she created considerable
                        distarbanos, violently abusing Mr. Marburg, who was eventually obliged to
                        send for a policeman. Mrs. Adams was then removed, loudly protesting, and
                        drove away. She afterwards returned, however, and for some time drove up and
                        down in front of the hotel, uttering loud and free comments on the conduct
                        of the proprietor. Her defence was that she had sent her daughter on the
                        previous day to find a doctor, who she believed was having supper there, to
                        ask him to come at once to visit her husband, who was seriously ill. The
                        Court criticised the defence on the grounds that Mr. Adams's illness was not
                        so serious as to prevent him from going on a moonlight drive with his wife
                        and daughter. Mrs. Adams was fined £2.</p>

                        <head>REPLY TO OUR CRITICISM.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,--I hope I shall not be trespassing unduly on your valuable space by
                        replying to the arguments adduced to support the view that "Al. Minbar" is
                        of a "dangerous character," and that by reason thereof the authorities were
                        justified in prohibiting its entry into the Sadan. I should in the first
                        instance point out that the term "suppressed," in that relation, was
                        erroneously employed, seeing that no copy of our publication had ever been
                        sent into the Sudan. Permission' was asked soon after our journal made its
                        appearance to authorise its transmission in the Sudan; and that permission
                        has recently been refused upon no stated grounds, though it is clear that
                        those responsible thought it inexpedient to let the paper into circulation.
                        With this decision I do not quarrel, because I have no doubt that it was
                        sincerely arrived at, but what I do regret is that the authorities should
                        not have taken care to be better informed. Had they been able to read our
                        articles in the original instead of being obliged to trust to others less
                        scrupulous and honourable than themselves, it would, I doubt not, have been
                        patent to them that "Al Minbar," far from being inimical to their interests,
                        has from the first initiated a policy favourable to them. Speaking at the
                        dinner given by the Press to Major Owen Bey on the occasion of our return
                        from the opening of the Nile-Red-Sea Railway, and subsequently on more than
                        one occasion in print, I expressed the opinion that the Sodan should be
                        regarded as part and parcel of Greater Egypt and that the interests of the
                        two are indissolubly bound ap together. So, too, as regards the question of
                        Egypt's contribution towards the expenditure in the Sudan. "Al Minbar” bas
                        invariably upheld the present arrangement on the grounds just stated,
                        namely, that the two countries should be regarded as forming an integral.
                        Can those views be regarded as in any sense "dangerous ?” But to come to
                        matters more immediately at issue. "Al Minbar” is accused of having
                        disseminated a statement by an anonymous German attributing to the English
                        the invention of cholera and plague without at once contradicting it. The
                        answer is simply this: The report was that of an interview with A well-known
                        German Orientalist who did not wish his name disclosed. Now I would ask. Is
                        it necessary to criticise in every such casei I should say not. To take the
                        most recent instance : "The Pall Mall Gazette" published a lengthy report of
                        an interview between its Paris correspondent and the editor of "El Lewa"
                        containing • maný statements, which, from the English point of view, were
                        "exceedingly dangerous" and the report of the interview was reproduced in
                        "The Egyptian Gazette" on the 12th inst. In neither instance was any
                        editorial comment appended thereto. I could oite hundreds of other instances
                        of an identical description. It must, therefore, I think, be taken as clear
                        that an editor is not bound to deny every statement published in his paper
                        on the authority of a third party, which he knows or has reasonable grounds
                        for believing to be untrue, and hence that accusation falls to the ground.
                        But "Al Minbar" is farther charged with unduly eulogising the Ottoman
                        Empire. All that I ogn say, in reply, is that whilst acknowledging H.I.M.
                        the Sultan as the Khalif of Islam, and expressing our loyalty to the
                        Khalilate, we have never forgotten to point out the reactionary tendencies
                        of the present Turkish Government, which like other governments will have
                        its time and pass away. And how could it be possible for any mind endowed
                        with a semblance of logio to ask in one breath for perfect, liberty and
                        equality on behalf of the Egyptians without at the same time condemning the
                        autocratic Government in Turkey? The thing is manifestly absurd.</p>
                    <p>"Al Minbar's" policy has throughout been "Egypt for the Egyptians." To show
                        that we have maintained that view I beg leave to quote from a leading
                        article in "Al Minbar” of the 24th July last in which the following passage
                        occurs :- "The Egyptians desire to be independent without being under any
                        autocrat either in Yildiz, Abdin, or Kasr El Doubara.” Of course we at the
                        same time defend the integrity of the Turkish Empire and desire to see it
                        regenerated and strong again amongst the nations of the world. Again we say
                        that no one who has a grain of political sense or experience can doubt that
                        for Egypt to become again a Turkish vilayet, as it was before the time of
                        Mohamed Aly, would be the graves of all misfortunes for one country. The
                        legation that oor journal obarged British cons and missionaries with
                        instigating the Armeans to rebel is without foundation. The rmeniang -wore

                    <p>The last of the suggestions made against "A Minbar," namely, that it is not
                        allowed to enter Turkey, is in reality an answer to a previous criticism,
                        viz, that "Al Minbar” has Turkish proclivities. Our journal has never
                        been<!-- [illegible]--> circulation in Turkey from the very fact that we do
                        not send any copies unless required by subscribers and newsvendors. The same
                        is the case as regards Tanie, Algeria, etc.</p>
                    <p>I think I have now dealt with all the points raise. It only remains for me to
                        add that in writing the above and the previous letter which you did me the

                        <head>PRIMITIVE PICTURE WRITING.</head>
                    <p>A very important essay relating to the primitive art and culture of the
                        ancient Egyptians is that of M. George Fouoart, "Sur la Decoration des Vases
                        de la période dite de Naggadeh," read by him before the French Academy.</p>
                    <p>The subject, as stated by M. Foucart, does not include all the pictorial
                        ornamental styles upon this primitive pottery, but is restricted to an
                        explanation of the meaning of a tableau frequently found, in more or less
                        modified form, and well known to Egyptologiste.</p>
                    <p>This is a sort of panorama depositing a boat, with elevated prow and stern,
                        containing a kind of naoo, looked at oursorily, appearing to be merely two
                        piles of timber united near their summits by a connecting bridge. From one
                        of the masses of freight or elsewhere on the vessel projects a flagstaff, or
                        guidon pole, bearing emblems; whilst one or more pålma extend from the
                        stern.</p>
                    <p>In the field of the picture are people with their arms uplifted, or carrying
                        boomerangs, gazelles and large birds, and a few small pyramidal objects,
                        which have been thought to indicate hillocks.</p>
                    <p>M. Foucart's theory, which is a most in, teresting one, is that these scenes
                        indicata a time when Egyptian writing had not passed out of the pictorial
                        stage. Thøge scenes upon the pottery are in fact trae hieroglyphs, and are
                        really a primitive panoramio display of what subsequently became the verbal
                        proscynom of the funeral stele, which in itself, when for private
                        personages, was but a copy of worship offered daily to the deities in their
                        temples ; and with extra splendour, in these edifices or outside them, at
                        thọ special fêtes of the gods.</p>
                    <p>The following is M. Foucart's interpretation of the scenes depicted, and it
                        will immediately appear how appositely his theory accounts for them. The
                        boat with its long rows of oars is the "barque divin” which every Egyptian
                        god had in his temple for the purpose of conveying him in a procession on
                        land, or if used only as a symbol of the deity's voyage -across the
                        celestial ocean or river, he embarked upon it and proceeded in procession on
                        the Nile.</p>
                    <p>The boat emblem therefore conveyed the idea that the fate of a god was
                        intended. Then the double connected pieces of ourgo are a representation of
                        the temple pylons, indicating, therefore, a religious festival proceeding
                        from the deity's earthly mansion.</p>
                    <p>The pole, or flagstaff, with its particular emblem Alsating from it, explains
                        which god's fête was intended ; and it is most rạmarkable that M. Foucart
                        hus beən able to select from these boat banners at least ten guidons, whose
                        figures he shows are the sacred symbols of as many divinities. These, as
                        might be expected, correspond in most cases with the ancient pome Totem gods
                        we know from other ralios of the very earliest Egyptian art. The one or more
                        palms at the prow or stern of the vessel, indicate the number of days'
                        duration of the festival, whilst the people with hands and arms uplifted
                        acclaim the passage of the sacred barque.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the deer, † birds, and triangular objects all refer to the great
                        festival sacrifices, and stand, pictorially, for the well-known rubric
                        inscribed, as it was recited, upon the funeral stelæ and temple rituals of
                        later date, which it will be remembered commence by promising a feast of
                        "thousands of gazelles and of birds and loaves, or cakes," these, latter
                        being represented in the vase talleans by the little pyramidal objects.</p>
                    <p>The stele, texts also inolade (as does the "Pancarte" or "Table of offerings
                        formalæ," a derivative from them) stuffs and vestments, and thậge M. Fougart
                        sometimes finds shown upon the vase drawings standing in bales, especially
                        on pottery found at Naggadeb. So these pictures are the prototypes of the
                        tomb paintings and reliefs; and, which is even more important, they are the
                        pictorial symbolic representation before, the later hieroglyphs developed
                        into the determinatives, and letters of the literary inscriptions upon the
                        funeral stelæ, and finally of the same texts whøn engrossed upon the
                        sepalohral papyri.</p>
                    <p>JOSEPH OFFORD.</p>
                    <p>†There appear to be four species of gazelles depicted on the Naggadeh
                        objects, and these therefore correspond to the four gazelles said, in a tomb
                        text at Hieraoonopolis, to be the canonical number to be utilised for
                        sacrifices</p>
